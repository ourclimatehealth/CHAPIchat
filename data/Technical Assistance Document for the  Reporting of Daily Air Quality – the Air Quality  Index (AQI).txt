This guidance is designed to aid local agencies in reporting air quality using the Air Quality Index (AQI) as 
required in 40 CFR Part 58.50 and according to 40 CFR Appendix G to Part 58. 
 
I. REPORTING THE AQI 
 
Do I have to report the AQI? 
 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with a population of more than 350,000 are required to report the 
AQI daily to the general public. The population of an MSA for purposes of index reporting is based on 
the latest available U.S. census population.  
 
How often do I report the AQI? 
 
MSAs must report the AQI daily, which is defined as at least five days each week. This definition allows 
for days when personnel are not available to provide the AQI report or for equipment failures. 
 
What goes in my AQI report? 
 
Required reporting:  
It takes a full 24 hours to obtain an AQI value (that’s 24 hourly values for PM or the max 1-hour or 8-
hour value in a 24-hour period for other pollutants), so you are in effect required to report yesterday’s 
AQI, including: 
• 
the reporting area 
• 
the reporting period   
• 
the critical pollutant (the pollutant with the highest AQI value) 
• 
the AQI value 
• 
the category descriptor and color (if your report uses color) shown in Table 1  
• 
the sensitive groups for all pollutants with an AQI over 100, as shown in Table 3 
 
Voluntary reporting: 
To make AQI reporting more useful to the public, most agencies also choose to report some or all of the 
following:  
• 
Forecast and current AQI values 
• 
Health effects and cautionary statements   
• 
Causes for unusual AQI values 
• 
The AQI for sub-areas of the reporting area 
• 
Pollutant concentrations 
• 
The name and AQI for other pollutants, particularly those with an AQI greater than 100 
• 
Statements that “blend” health effects and cautionary information for more than one 
pollutant, if there is more than one pollutant with an AQI greater than 100

What health effects and cautionary statements should I use if the AQI goes above 500? 
If the AQI is higher than 500, it is called “Beyond the AQI.” Use the same information that is for the 
Hazardous category.  
 
 
Do I have to report the AQI if my values are low? 
If the AQI values for all of the pollutants remain below 50 for a year, then you may report the AQI at 
your discretion. In subsequent years, if any pollutant level rises to where the AQI would be above 50, 
then you must report the AQI. 
If a specific pollutant remains below 50 for an extended period of time (a season or a year), you may 
exclude that pollutant from your AQI calculation. 
 
 
   
How is the AQI reported? 
AQI reports take many forms 
– from traditional media like 
television, newspaper, radio, 
and phone, to more digital 
forms such as widgets, apps, 
web pages, and social media.  
The purpose of the AQI is to 
inform people about their air 
quality so they can take steps 
to protect their health. This is 
especially important 
whenever the AQI exceeds 
100. To reach the most 
people, try to deliver the AQI 
in as many ways as possible.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The AQI is reported in many formats. 
 
Tomorrow will be a code red 
air quality day for Center 
City.  The cold winter air, 
morning traffic, and wood 
smoke are expected to cause 
particle pollution to rise to 
unhealthy levels. People 
with heart or lung disease, 
older adults, and children 
should avoid strenuous 
activities. 
7 
  
Do I have to forecast the AQI? 
Forecasting is encouraged, but it is not required. A prediction for the 
next day or several days allows people to plan their activities so that 
they can reduce or avoid exposure to air pollution. Good forecasts 
require data, computational resources, and expertise. EPA provides 
guidance if you are interested in starting a forecasting program. For 
more information, see Guidelines for Developing an Air Quality 
Forecasting Program in the Resources section.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Display of AQI forecast 
Do I need to have air quality action days as part of my program? 
No. The use of air quality action days or community action programs, which are usually based on AQI 
forecasts, is voluntary. However, action days and similar programs can provide significant benefits, 
especially when they directly and effectively communicate to at-risk groups about air quality and 
associated health effects. Air quality action days may be called by state or local air agencies when the 
AQI will get into the unhealthy ranges. Different agencies call them at different levels, such as Orange or 
Red or sometimes Yellow.  
 
How is the AQI reported in real time? 
EPA uses the NowCast to approximate the complete daily AQI during any given hour. Even on days when 
the AQI forecast predicts unhealthy conditions, pollution levels may be lower and better for outdoor 
activities during some parts of the day. Providing current conditions gives people the power to take 
action to reduce outdoor activities and exposure when necessary and protect their health.  
The NowCast calculation uses longer averages during periods of stable air quality and shorter averages 
when air quality is changing rapidly, such as during a fire. The NowCast allows current conditions maps 
to align more closely with what people are actually seeing or experiencing.

II. CALCULATING THE AQI 
 
How do I calculate the AQI from pollutant concentration data? 
 
The AQI is the highest value calculated for each pollutant as follows:  
a. Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors within each reporting area and truncate 
as follows: 
Ozone (ppm) – truncate to 3 decimal places 
PM2.5 (µg/m3) – truncate to 1 decimal place 
PM10 (µg/m3) – truncate to integer 
CO (ppm) – truncate to 1 decimal place 
SO2 (ppb) – truncate to integer 
NO2 (ppb) – truncate to integer 
  
 
b. Using Table 5, find the two breakpoints that contain the concentration. 
 
c. Using Equation 1, calculate the index. 
 
d. Round the index to the nearest integer. 
 
 
Equation 1:  
 
 
 
Where Ip = the index for pollutant p 
Cp = the truncated concentration of pollutant p 
BPHi = the concentration breakpoint that is greater than or equal to Cp  
BPLo = the concentration breakpoint that is less than or equal to Cp 
              
 
IHi = the AQI value corresponding to BPHi 
ILo = the AQI value corresponding to BPLo

1 Areas are generally required to report the AQI based on 8-hour ozone values.  However, there are a 
small number of areas where an AQI based on 1-hour ozone values would be more precautionary.  In 
these cases, in addition to calculating the 8-hour ozone index value, the 1-hour ozone value may be 
calculated, and the maximum of the two values reported. 
 
2 8-hour O3 values do not define higher AQI values (≥ 301).  AQI values of 301 or higher are calculated 
with 1-hour O3 concentrations. 
 
3 If a different SHL for PM2.5 is promulgated, these numbers will change accordingly. 
 
4 1-hour SO2 values do not define higher AQI values (≥ 200). AQI values of 200 or greater are calculated 
with 24-hour SO2 concentrations. 
 
 
11 
  
How do I use the table and the equation and my concentration data to calculate the AQI? 
Suppose you have an 8-hour ozone value of 0.07853333.  First, truncate the value to 0.078.  Then refer 
to the 8-hour ozone in table 5 for the values that fall above and below your value (0.071-0.085).  In this 
case, the 0.078 value falls within the index values of 101 to 150.  Now you have all the numbers needed 
to use the equation. 
 
 
 
 
So an 8-hour value of 0.07853333 corresponds to an index value of 126. 
 
What if I have values for more pollutants? 
Suppose you have an 8-hour ozone value of 0.078 ppm, a PM2.5 value of 35.9 μg/m3, and a CO value of 
8.4 ppm.  You apply the equation 3-times: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The AQI is 126, with ozone as the responsible pollutant. 
 
How do I use both ozone 1-hour and 8-hour values? 
You must calculate the 8-hour values, and you may also calculate the 1-hour values.  If you calculate 
both, you must report the higher AQI value. 
Suppose you had a 1-hour value of 0.162 ppm and an 8-hour value of 0.078 ppm. Then you apply the 
equation twice: 
 
In this case, the index is 148 (the maximum of 148 and 126) and the responsible pollutant is ozone.

How do I calculate AQI values for SO2? 
 
EPA strengthened the primary standard for SO2 in 2010.  Because there was not enough health 
information to inform changing the upper end of the AQI for SO2, the upper end continues to use the 
24-hour average SO2 concentration. The lower end of the AQI uses the daily max 1-hour SO2 
concentration. 
If you have a daily max 1-hour SO2 concentration below 305 ppb, then use the breakpoints in Table 5 to 
calculate the AQI value.   
If you have a 24-hour average SO2 concentration greater than or equal to 305 ppb, then use the 
breakpoints in Table 5 to calculate the AQI value.  If you have a 24-hour value in this range, it will always 
result in a higher AQI value than a 1-hour value would.  
On rare occasions, you could have a day where the daily max 1-hour concentration is at or above 305 
ppb but when you try to use the  24-hour average to calculate the AQI value, you find that the 24-hour 
concentration is not above 305 ppb.  If this happens, use 200 for the lower and upper AQI breakpoints 
(ILo and IHi) in Equation 1 to calculate the AQI value based on the daily max 1-hour value.  This 
effectively fixes the AQI value at 200 exactly, which ensures that you get the highest possible AQI value 
associated with your 1-hour concentration on such days. 
 
What do I do with concentrations for pollutants that have blank places in the table for Breakpoints for 
the AQI? 
 
Disregard those numbers.  Suppose you had a 1-hour ozone value of 0.104 ppm and an 8-hour ozone 
value of 0.078 ppm.  First you disregard the 1-hour ozone value because it is less than 0.125ppm.  Then 
you calculate the index for the 8-hour ozone value as before:

III. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
 
 
Q. Why doesn’t my area report an Air Quality Index value? 
A. Towns and cities with 350,000 or fewer inhabitants are not required to report the AQI. Some may not 
have monitors. In addition, AirNow is a voluntary program and some state or local air quality monitoring 
agencies may not submit data to AirNow.  
 
Q. The other day, the air quality in my area was reported as green, or good air quality.  However, it 
was pretty hazy outside.  Why didn’t the AQI report this accurately? 
A. If this was an AQI forecast, there are still a few areas of the United States that only forecast for ozone 
and not particle pollution. It is possible that the ozone AQI forecast was “GOOD” while the hazy 
conditions experienced were due to particle pollution. In this instance, the reported AQI forecast may 
have only represented ozone. 
There are also occasions where hazy conditions may be due primarily to high humidity and not pollution. 
On these days, it is still good to check the AQI maps and forecasts to make sure that pollution is not the 
primary cause of the haze. 
 
Q. How do I get my local media outlets to show the AQI? 
 
A. Many local media outlets choose to display the AQI as part of their weather reports. The text and 
graphics they use are usually developed and produced by private weather service companies, who have 
access to air quality data through AirNow. Try approaching the media person who is the customer of the 
weather service provider. This could be a newspaper editor or the television or radio station manager. 
 
In general, media outlets want to provide more health-based information to their readers.  However, it 
may take some effort to establish a relationship and educate decision makers about the importance of 
providing air quality information to the public. When you meet with them, bring along this guidance 
document or several examples showing how other media outlets publish the AQI. Emphasize that air 
quality is weather, news and health all in one. Make sure they have the proper software to access and 
display the data from the weather service company. Keep in mind that they may want to display air 
quality information only during periods of high pollution levels, when it is considered more newsworthy. 
 
Q. If the AQI reported in the local media is incorrect, what should I do?  
A. Common problems with AQI reporting in the local media include either reporting data values that are 
wrong or reporting pollutant concentrations instead of the AQI.  Another frequent mistake is to report 
inconsistent AQI colors or terminology, as well as incorrect pollutant names. Establishing a good working 
relationship with the local media and educating them about how misleading or erroneous AQI 
information can impact their followers could help minimize potential problems. We recommend that 
you first notify the media outlet directly about any error so they can relay discrepancies to their weather 
service provider as a paying customer. If you have difficulty getting the media outlet to correct the issue, 
you could team with other health and nongovernmental organizations to approach them with a united 
message and request.

Q. Can AirNow help me meet the reporting requirements for the AQI? 
A. AirNow is one way you can submit, store, and display your AQI values. This includes the required 
elements of AQI reporting and the voluntary elements. The information you submit to airnow.gov is 
reported in national and state/local pages on the website. It is available to anyone through the airnow 
app and widget and Enviroflash emails. It is also available for distribution to media and weather service 
provider companies.  
 
Q. Why doesn't the AQI cover toxic air pollutants or air toxics? 
A. While the AQI is an excellent indicator of the air quality resulting from ozone and particulate matter, 
it does not directly include health implications from air pollutants such as air toxics. Adverse health 
effects from air toxics are generally not believed to be episodic in nature like ozone and particulate 
matter, and are usually evaluated on a longer term, or chronic, basis. For information on concentrations 
of air toxics, refer to EPA’s National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) Website at:  
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata/. 
 
Q. Why does EPA issue AQI forecasts only for ozone and particle pollution? 
 
A. AQI reporting is required for all criteria pollutants when they have an index value of 50 or above. 
Most cities forecast for ozone and particle pollution as these pollutants are the major sources of 
unhealthy air quality around 99% of the time. However, several cities forecast for all five pollutants- 
ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. 
 
Q. What is the NowCast and what does it have to do with the AQI? 
 
A. The Air Quality Index is based on daily air quality summaries, specifically daily maximums or daily 
averages.  It is not valid to use shorter-term (e.g. hourly) data to calculate an AQI value.  However, real-
time reporting requires shorter-term data to caution people in time for them to reduce their 24-hour 
exposure.  The NowCast is EPA’s endorsed method for relating short-term (less than 24-hour) data to 
the Air Quality Index for the purposes of real-time reporting.  
 
Q. How is the AQI computed when the pollutant concentrations are beyond the Hazardous category 
(AQI above 500)? 
 
A. When concentrations are above the range of the Hazardous category, they are called “Beyond the 
AQI”.  However, an AQI value can still be computed to indicate relative magnitude.  To do this, use the 
same linear relationship that is used for the Hazardous category. Use the regular formula for computing 
an AQI value and use the Hazardous category breakpoints in the calculation. 
 
Q. How are “Beyond the AQI” values (AQI above 500) handled in the NowCast? 
 
A. They are not handled differently. Compute the NowCast concentration as you normally would and 
use the Hazardous category breakpoints to compute the NowCast AQI value. 
 
 
15 
  
Q. What should people do if the AQI is above 500? 
 
A. If the AQI is higher than 500, it is called “Beyond the AQI.” Follow the recommendations for the 
Hazardous category. Everyone should take steps to reduce their exposure. Stay indoors – in a room or 
building with filtered air – and reduce activity levels to reduce the amount of pollution you breathe into 
your lungs.  
 
Q. How is the ozone AQI calculation affected by the revision of the ozone standard? 
 
A. When the ozone standard was revised in 2015, the data handling for the daily max was modified to 
use only the 8-hour averages starting at 7am. This was done to avoid double-counting an exceedance 
from a single, short-term episode that spans the nighttime hours of the first day into the early hours of 
the second day. The daily maximum 8-hour average used for computing the AQI value is the same daily 
maximum 8-hour average described in the data handling for the revised ozone standard (i.e. it is based 
on the 17 consecutive moving 8-hour periods in each day, beginning with the 8-hour period from 7am to 
3pm, and ending with the 8-hour period from 11pm to 7am). 
 
 
 
 
Q. Should I use particulate matter or particle pollution when speaking with the public? 
 
A. Based on focus group testing by EPA, people better understand and prefer the term “particle 
pollution” than "particulate matter." 
 
Q. Why are some people using low-cost, compact sensors to measure air quality? 
 
A. Many citizens are interested in learning more about local air quality where they live, work, and play. 
Low-cost, compact, sometimes-portable sensors are becoming more popular for collecting real-time 
16 
  
(usually 1-minute) air quality data. EPA scientists created the Air Sensor Toolbox for Citizen Scientists to 
provide information about sensor performance and how to interpret the data from sensors. 
Learn more at http://www.epa.gov/air-research/air-sensor-toolbox-citizen-scientists 
 
Q. Can I apply the AQI colors to 1-minute data from low-cost air quality sensors?  
 
A. No. Sensors generally report 1-minute data, and health studies do not tell us what a single minute of 
exposure to a pollutant may mean. The AQI is based on EPA’s national air quality standards, which come 
from health studies that show the effects of longer exposures.  
 
Q. What does the Village Green Project do? 
 
A. The Village Green Project is an innovative prototype air and weather measurement system built into a 
park bench. The station engages communities in air pollution awareness at a local level. The pilot station 
in Durham, North Carolina monitors several common air pollutants in real-time and makes the data 
available online and by smartphone. The solar and wind powered station provides minute-to-minute air 
measurements for ozone, particle pollution and weather conditions. The Village Green Project is 
expanding to other communities across the U.S. 
Learn more at http://www.epa.gov/air-research/village-green-project 
 
 
Q. What is the ozone monitoring season for each state? 
 
A. EPA requires ozone monitoring during the time of year when weather conditions are most favorable 
for ozone formation. This season varies by state. In some states with warmer climates, monitoring is 
required year-round. In states where the climate is colder, ozone monitoring is required for as little as 
five months during the summertime. You can find a list of ozone monitoring seasons by state in 40 CFR 
Part 58 Appendix D, Table D-3.
