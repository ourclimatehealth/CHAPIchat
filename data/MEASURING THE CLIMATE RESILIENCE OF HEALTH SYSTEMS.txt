1 INTRODUCTION
Climate change adversely affects population health and health systems. Health systems include all
organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health (1).
By supporting the development and application of essential policies and programmes, in the context
of a changing climate, this report seeks to promote the strengthening of health systems (2).
Figure 1, highlights that climate change is altering hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities that can
interact to increase or decrease risks to population health and health systems. Enhanced resilience
decreases the likelihood that impacts will occur as well as the severity of the impacts that do occur.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how vulnerable health systems can be when confronted
with a large hazard that stresses existing capacity to provide optimal health services.
Health decision-makers, health professionals and civil society organizations recognize the risks
posed by climate change and the need for proactive measures to plan for the impacts. Over two
decades of adapting to the health risks of climate change have demonstrated that evidence-based
actions can protect vulnerable people and communities.
Figure 1: Climate-sensitive health risks (9)

For over 20 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been supporting efforts by health
authorities to prepare for the challenges posed by climate change by implementing a risk management
approach to strengthen health systems, learn from these efforts, and share information to support
essential collaborations and partnerships. In 2015, WHO published the Operational Framework
for Building Climate Resilient Health Systems (3) to guide users on conducting vulnerability and
adaptation (V&A) assessments; developing comprehensive medium- and long-term adaptation
plans (e.g., Health National Adaptation Plans (HNAPs)); and to design and implement interventions
and programmes on climate change and health. Since then, the Operational Framework has been
used to support countries’ efforts to transition to a system-based approach to health adaptation. In
2020, WHO published guidance for climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health care
(4). That guidance aims to enhance the capacity of health care facilities to protect and improve the
health of target communities in the context of a changing climate, and to empower environmentally
sustainable health care facilities. Achieving these aims is an important component of universal health
coverage (UHC).
The Operational Framework describes ten functions of health systems necessary to increase climate
resilience, implemented around the six building blocks that support the delivery of UHC (5), see Figure 2.
Complementary and targeted guidance related to some of the key functions is presented in Box 1,
such as undertaking V&A assessments, increasing the climate resilience of health facilities, assessing
vulnerabilities in health care facilities in the context of climate change, and developing HNAPs.

funding streams.
3.6 Ten components for building climate resilience
In order to provide a comprehensive health response to climate change, health decision
makers need to consider the full range of functions that need to be strengthened to increase
climate resilience.
Starting from health sector building blocks, and taking into account existing global and
regional mandates, the operational framework elaborates on 10 components that together
provide a comprehensive approach to integrating climate resilience into existing health
systems. These can provide the structure for a health adaptation plan, including the
allocation of roles and responsibilities, as well as human and financial resources.

Box 1: WHO guidance to protect health from climate change
Recent guidance developed by WHO to help health authorities to prepare for the health risks
of climate change include:
 Climate Change and Health – Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment (6) – provides
basic and flexible guidance on conducting a national or subnational assessment of
current and future vulnerability to the health risks of climate change, and of policies and
programmes that could increase resilience, taking into account the multiple determinants
of climate-sensitive health outcomes.
 WHO Guidance for Developing Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health
Facilities (4) – provides health professionals and health care facility managers with key
tools and interventions to build resilience and improve environmental sustainability in
health care facilities. A companion report provides checklists to assess vulnerabilities in
health care facilities in the context of climate change (7).
 WHO Checklists to Assess Vulnerabilities in Health Care Facilities in the Context of
Climate Change (7) – provides checklists to help health care facility managers and other
health workers understand the climate risks that health care facilities may face, specifically
in terms of existing vulnerabilities and possible impacts, and support them in taking
appropriate action.
 WHO Guidance to Protect Health from Climate Change Through Health Adaptation
Planning (8) – assists health authorities with identifying national strategic goals for building
health resilience to climate change and developing a national plan with prioritized activities
to achieve these goals, within a specific time period and given available resources.
 Quality Criteria for Health National Adaptation Plans (HNAPs) (9) – provides examples of
good practice in HNAP development and assists countries in setting the foundation for
establishing a long-term iterative HNAP process.
As countries continue to prepare health systems for additional climate change, and as risks to health
continue to increase with the possibility of more severe impacts, information and guidance are
needed to understand when a health system can be considered resilient. Information and guidance
are similarly required to recognize when adaptation efforts are not having the intended results, and
whether specific components of the Operational Framework should be prioritized for effectively
strengthening climate resilience.

1.1 What is resilience?
Resilience, health system resilience and climate resilient health systems are related concepts. Although
there are multiple definitions of these terms, they share key commonalities. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines resilience, in the context of climate change, as “the
capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event, trend, or
disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and
structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation” (10). Health
system resilience, independent from climate change, can be understood as the capacity of health
actors, institutions and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core
functions when a crisis hits; and reorganize if conditions require it (11). Others build on this definition
to suggest that resilience is the ability to prepare for, manage (absorb, adapt and transform) and
learn from shocks (12). Linking these two definitions, climate resilient health systems are those that
are capable of anticipating, responding to, coping with, recovering from, and adapting to climaterelated shocks and stresses, so as to bring about sustained improvements in population health,
despite an unstable climate (3).
This definition highlights that resilience is measured at the scale of a health system. Health systems
are composed of multiple actors, infrastructure and activities, along with collaborations with other
sectors and entities. This report provides insights into the routine monitoring of the climate-related
shocks and stresses that will impact each of the ten functions of health systems identified in the
Operational Framework, to identify weaknesses that need to be addressed to enhance preparedness
for a changing climate (13).
1.1.1 Climate-related shocks and stresses
Figure 3 shows in a simplified form how a climate-related stress (a slow onset event such as a
drought or sea-level rise) or a sudden shock (such as a tropical cyclone, or a heatwave) could impact
a health system and its capacity to respond. The response should be proportionate to the magnitude
of the hazard, the extent of the exposure of populations and health care facilities, the underlying
vulnerabilities of people and communities, and the capacities of health systems. Depending on the
capacity to respond, there are a range of possible outcomes: from health system collapse with severe
impacts on the population; to recovery to the pre-event state; to system transformation where future
threats, including those made worse by climate change, have less impact.
As a stress multiplier, climate change is increasing the probability of new and intensifying compound
and cascading risks that stretch the capacity of health systems and leave less time between events
for the systems to recover. It is increasingly likely that climate-related shocks and stresses will
co-occur over short time periods. There will likely be increasing numbers of compound and cascading
events that threaten people and health systems. The cessation of a stress may come in the form
of a shock (such as heavy rains that end a drought, resulting in flooding). Risk factors (e.g., hazard,
exposure and vulnerability) can also interact and compound, such as heatwaves interacting with dry
conditions to increase wildfire hazard (7). The upstream determinants of risk can similarly interact,
such as when inequities within the population result in certain groups (e.g., low income, marginalized)
living in areas with higher exposure to climate-related hazards and with limited capacity to cope with

5
them. These interactions can create cascading risks, with one event or trend triggering another thus
increasing their impact, particularly where a population’s vulnerabilities are higher.
This implies that the resilience of health systems is dynamic, with no assurance that resilience today
will provide adequate health protection tomorrow. This may be because the magnitude of hazards
may increase, or unanticipated hazards may occur, or because health systems may be resilient to
individual hazards but not to multiple hazards occurring in close proximity. Failure to prepare for
climate change now by bolstering the resilience of health systems increases the probability that
hazards become disasters and complex emergencies that cause severe impacts to human health
and communities.

1.1.2 Resilience requires monitoring and preparation for future risks
Understanding the resilience of each function of a health system does not provide sufficient
information to understand how well the system works as a whole. The uneven effectiveness of
individual components of a health system can decrease its overall resilience. Indicators are required
that provide insights into how well the total system is functioning when faced with challenges from
current and future climate change risks.

Addressing climate change risks to population health and improving health system resilience requires
proactive efforts to avoid being caught in a cycle of responsive or forced adaptation when shocks and
stresses challenge a health system’s function. It also requires a focus on monitoring and managing
future risks, including from more severe shocks and stresses to health systems or on previously
unanticipated hazards, as well as thoughtful planning with decision-makers outside of the health
sector. Inter-sectoral collaboration can help achieve large and immediate health co-benefits from
adaptation and from measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while increasing the resilience
of health supporting systems (e.g., transport, food, water, etc.). These actions can, in turn, reduce
impacts to health system operations including by lowering health care demand.
Measuring the climate resilience of a health system is most effectively done with information and
indicators that are tailored to the needs of the health authority using it. This exercise should build
upon, but not duplicate the results of existing national health surveillance and related monitoring
systems, as well as regional and international monitoring and reporting initiatives such as the WHO
Health and Climate Change Global Survey, the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change,
the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. This
guidance provides illustrative examples of the different types of indicators as well as the process of
identifying them but it is not comprehensive. The guidance should be used to initiate discussions
on which indicators are of the greatest relevance to the local or national health concerns about a
changing climate.
1.2 Target audience
This report assists health authorities – from local to national levels – in their efforts to chart progress
towards developing health systems that protect populations from current climate-related hazards and
that are prepared for future climate shocks and stresses. Because many of the actions and indicators
of progress are relevant for actions taken by decision-makers in other sectors, this report can also
inform their adaptation activities. To this end, it provides a framework and suggested approach for
measuring the climate resilience of health systems.
1.3 Guide to using this document
In Section 2, this document outlines a framework and method for measuring climate resilient health
systems, discussing the linkages among upstream determinants of health, health system capacity
and adaptation, and health outcomes in a changing climate. Section 3 then provides information
on criteria for selecting indicators as well as tips on selecting the first set. Section 4 provides useful
data sources health authorities can use to populate their indicators as part of V&A assessments
or other studies. The final section discusses how the information from application of the indicators
can be used to inform policy processes and programme development by health authorities to plan
for climate change impacts.

2 FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING
THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE OF
HEALTH SYSTEMS
Climate-related risks result from the interaction of the hazards created by a changing climate, the
populations and regions exposed to those hazards, and the underlying vulnerabilities to exposures.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will contribute to reducing future climate hazards. However,
the inertia of the climate system means that reduced emissions will not affect the frequency and
intensity of hazards in the short-term; many will continue to pose serious threats to health. Climate
change is increasing the probability that thresholds are crossed in terms of health system response
during disasters and public health emergencies, overwhelming the coping capacities of health
systems, with catastrophic impacts to communities. For example, rapid and extensive sea-level rise
with associated increases in the magnitude of storm surges may increase the likelihood of such
thresholds being crossed in the future. This means the key areas of interventions for health systems
should focus on managing current exposures and reducing current vulnerabilities to help reduce the
possible impacts of potentially more severe impacts of climate change. Health system investments,
particularly in fixed assets, should consider current vulnerabilities as well as projected future risks
to foster long-term resilience.
The performance of key programmes and processes (e.g., health sector staff training, development
of emergency management plans in health facilities, climate proofing health infrastructures, public
education and outreach) can be monitored along with any population health and/or health system
impacts to develop strategies for continuous improvements to build resilience to climate change.
This includes a focus on strengthening the health system functions that are the weakest and focus
on communities and populations that are particularly vulnerable.
2.1 Understanding linkages among upstream determinants of health,
health system capacity, and adaptation and health system resilience
outcomes in a changing climate
Figure 4 proposes a framework to identify methods and indicators to measure climate resilience
and implement necessary health system adaptations. The Framework for Measuring the Climate
Resilience of Health Systems starts with climate variability and change and illustrates the connection
among three distinct parts that require measurement: i) upstream determinants of exposure and
vulnerability; ii) climate resilience of health system functions; and iii) outcomes of health system
resilience.
 Upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability: the goal is to identify and measure
environmental factors and trends as well as the exposure pathways that are important to health
outcomes in a specific jurisdiction. It is also relevant to identify and measure key socioeconomic
factors and trends, and the existing vulnerabilities and susceptibilities of broader systems.
8
 Climate resilience of health systems functions: the goal is to measure current health
system capacity and adaptation efforts based upon the ten components of WHO’s Operational
Framework most relevant to a specific health authority area by accessing available data in
collaboration with partners within and outside of the health sector.
 Outcomes of health system resilience: these are measured with two sets of indicators that
focus on climate change-related health outcomes and health system outcomes, to measure
progress towards resilience.
The framework can be used to measure progress towards climate resilience in health systems
through indicators that track changes in: the upstream determinants of exposures and vulnerabilities;
the robustness of each function of health systems; the overall capacity of a health system to manage
climate-related shocks and stresses; and the extent to which resilience outcomes change following
adaptation interventions. Short- and longer-term climate-related risks need to be monitored to ensure
that near-term interventions build flexibility and capacity to prepare for and manage additional
climate change impacts over the coming decades.
The centre of Figure 4, ‘Climate resilience of health system functions’ shows the interlinkages
within the ten components of climate resilient health systems. Indicators developed for the different
components would focus on the extent to which each component is prepared for climate change.
For example, are the policies and programmes regularly evaluated and modified to ensure continued
effectiveness as the climate continues to change? Does the health system have the capacity, training
and tools to make quick pivots in operations and service delivery with emerging information on risks?
Adaptability is one key for fostering resilience; another is focusing explicitly on increasing flexibility
for the development and implementation of future adaptation options.
However, climate resilience will depend on more than the sufficient functioning of each building
block of health systems – it will also depend on the effective interactions of the building blocks when
faced with a shock or stress. As these increase in frequency and intensity over time, the demands on
the individual components of health systems are likely to be more difficult to manage. No one single
component will define resilience – the coordinated functioning of all components is required. It is
proposed that indicators for each of the sub-categories included in the Framework are integrated
into the monitoring system for climate resilient health systems. This will ensure a systems-based
approach to measuring climate resilience.
The health sector is responsible for monitoring those indicators related to ‘Climate resilience of
health system functions’ and ‘Outcomes of health system resilience’. Progress across the different
components of the Operational Framework will contribute to increasing overall climate resilience.
Data are available for most, if not all, upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability from
sources external to the health system, often in country statistics from different government agencies
(e.g., environment, meteorological services, finance, population census and others). The health sector
will have to ensure coordination and facilitate the sharing of data collected elsewhere.

2.2 Monitoring upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability
Climate change operates over decades or longer, altering daily, weekly and seasonal weather patterns,
sea-level rise and ocean acidification. The extent to which these changes could affect population
health and health systems depends on a range of interacting environmental and socioeconomic
factors and trends. Climate change is a risk multiplier, interacting with environmental factors such
as air pollution, land use change, biodiversity loss and desertification; these then affect exposure
pathways, including water and food access and safety. Socioeconomic factors such as demographic
change, economic growth, urbanization, investments in science and technology development, and
the extent of gender equality and population inequities affect vulnerability and susceptibility. Each
of these factors has multiple components that may affect the burden of climate-sensitive health
outcomes and the effectiveness of health systems, such as the extent to which urbanization plans
address the quality of housing stock. Together, these factors affect the climate resilience of health
system functions.
For example, heatwaves can affect health systems by increasing demands for health care,
putting pressure on health systems and service delivery. The magnitude and pattern of risks of
heatwave-related mortality in a region depends on urbanization, land use (extent of green and
blue spaces), infrastructure, air pollution, age structure of the population, proportion of people with
chronic diseases that increase susceptibility, access to cooling and other factors. Therefore, efforts
to understand how heat-related mortality could change with climate change are more robust when
these factors are considered along with climate change, instead of just using projections of rising
temperatures over coming decades. Many upstream determinants will change over time with the
effect of exacerbating or ameliorating the health risks of heatwaves. Incorporating into projections
assumptions about population growth and ageing, urbanization rates, land use change, economic
growth and investments can provide insights into approaches for closing inequity gaps associated
with, for example, heat-related mortality.
Social indicators monitor variables interacting with climate-related hazards that determine
vulnerability and sensitivity. Examples include demographic data (e.g., number of young people),
the availability of safe water, literacy/education rates (e.g., proportion of illiterate persons aged over
18), urbanization rates, access to health services, and poverty rates (e.g., proportion of persons living
in poverty).
Indicators of these upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability are generally already being
collected by the Ministry of Health (e.g., number of adults over the age of 65 years and therefore
more vulnerable to heatwaves) or are being collected by other sectors, agencies and civil society. For
example, other government bodies often collect data on demographics, urbanization and weather
and climate. Efforts to acquire data for indicators selected to measure climate resilient health systems
will, therefore, require collaboration with officials in other ministries, agencies and organizations that
collect this information.
Indicators of upstream environmental and socioeconomic drivers can assist health officials and
others to identify populations at higher risk of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Depending on the
jurisdiction, examples could include the proportion of households affected by floods, drought and
storms per month; the proportion of households without regular access to safe water; the proportion 
11
of the population with chronic diseases and/or over 65 years of age; or the number of deaths due
to floods, droughts and storms. These and similar indicators can monitor how the composition and
distribution of exposed and vulnerable groups change over time as the climate continues to warm.
2.3 Monitoring the climate resilience of health systems
The Framework for Measuring the Climate Resilience of Health Systems (Figure 4) highlights a
number of key components of health systems that are integral for improving the capacity to address
growing risks to health from climate change. It recognizes the central importance of health information
systems as well as service delivery in keeping people and health systems safe from climate change,
but also identifies leadership, the health workforce, governance and financing as well as resilient
and environmentally sustainable technologies and infrastructure as being equally important.
As Figure 4 illustrates, health information systems that guide adaptation efforts are supported
through health and climate change research; climate change and health V&A assessments; and
risk monitoring and warning systems that integrate climate and weather information. Climate resilient
service delivery depends upon the development of climate-informed health programmes; sustained
efforts to manage key determinants of health; and robust emergency preparedness and management
systems that can address threats from acute shocks and stresses from extreme weather events and
disasters and related public health emergencies. In addition, efforts to develop a knowledgeable
and trained health workforce and to develop new climate resilient technologies and infrastructures
(for example, in the building of new health facilities) are strategic activities by health authorities to
prepare for climate change.
The Framework recognizes the interplay of local to national vulnerabilities, capacities and actors and
institutions as well as the requirement for strong leadership, governance and financing mechanisms.
Leadership and governance, for example, can have an important influence on empowering the
health workforce, and in supporting climate-informed service delivery. Furthermore, a range of actors
from local to national organizations and institutions are responsible for preparing for, responding to,
coping with and recovering from the health impacts associated with climate variability and change.
Therefore, collaboration with decision-makers outside of the health sector is critical to maximize
climate resilience.
Programming that systematically considers climate change in health system activities will make
new demands on technical knowledge, infrastructure and capacities, require enhanced and novel
surveillance, and necessitate engagement across all sectors where climate change-related impacts
may affect human health (e.g., power generation and transmission). Adequate and sustained climate
and health financing is required to support all these functions.
Sample indicators for each of the categories included under ‘Climate resilience of health systems
functions’ in the Framework can be found in the WHO Operational Framework (3) (Figure 2). These
may support efforts by health authorities to develop their own approach for assessing progress
towards climate resilience, including the creation of jurisdiction-specific indicators that can be
monitored over time.
12
2.4 Monitoring outcomes of health system resilience
Most health systems are already reporting numbers of climate-sensitive injuries, illnesses and deaths
for a range of health outcomes. In addition, years of life lost from climate change can be used as an
aggregate measure of the overall burden of disease that could be attributed to a changing climate.
These data are essential for understanding trends in health outcomes themselves and/or trends
in vulnerability, such as numbers of deaths in a heatwave or the proportion of the population that
is vulnerable to extreme heat. Increasing investment in adaptation should lead to reductions in the
numbers of adverse health outcomes and/or on changes in the strength of the association between
hazard and health outcome over time. For example, the number of people exposed to heatwaves may
remain the same or increase over time, but if resilience is increasing, then the rate of adverse health
outcomes would decrease with greater awareness and effective adaptation interventions. Through
a V&A assessment, baselines can be established and key indicators of the population health risks
of climate change identified against which progress towards improving health can be measured.
Climate change affects not only population health but also the overall functioning of health systems
and health care facilities. For example, severe storms, floods and wildfires can have devastating
impacts on hospitals, clinics, community health centres and care homes (Box 2, below). Depending
on the national context, countries will face different climate-sensitive health risks.
Box 2: Climate resilient health care facilities
Climate resilience is needed in the four fundamental requirements for providing safe and
quality health care in the context of climate change: (i) health workforce – adequate numbers
of skilled human resources, with decent working conditions, empowered and informed to
respond to environmental challenges; (ii) water, sanitation, hygiene and health care waste
management – the sustainable and safe management of water, sanitation and health care
waste services; (iii) energy – sustainable and resilient energy services; and (iv) infrastructure,
technologies and products – appropriate infrastructure, technologies, products and processes,
including all the operations that allow for the efficient functioning of a health care facility. An
assessment tool for resilience is provided in the WHO Guidance for Climate-Resilient and
Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities (4). A companion report, Checklists to
Assess Vulnerability in Health Care Facilities in the Context of Climate Change (7), contains
checklists to assess vulnerabilities in health care facilities and are intended for health care
facility managers and other health workers aiming to understand the climate risks (large or
small) that health care facilities may face, in terms of existing vulnerabilities, possible impacts
and what actions are required. The checklists can be used to establish a baseline with regards
to resilience in health care facilities. This will be used to inform the design of interventions to
strengthen overall resilience to climate change. The checklists can also be used for iterative
vulnerability assessments in health care facilities, to help health care facility managers: (i)
identify climate hazards of concern; (ii) assess current vulnerability for each of the hazards,
in each of the key components of health care facilities; and (iii) understand potential impacts
posed by climate variability and change in each of the key components of health care facilities.
Checklists for key climate hazards (floods, storms, sea-level rise, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires
and cold waves) consist of separate sets for assessing vulnerabilities and impacts.

3 SELECTING INDICATORS FOR
MEASURING THE CLIMATE
RESILIENCE OF HEALTH SYSTEMS
A minimum set of indicators should be identified to monitor the resilience of health systems, based
on priorities identified in the national V&A assessment, HNAP, or programmes being implemented
for climate-related risks, and building on selected indicators already being tracked by the Ministry of
Health and other partners. The process of identifying a minimum set of indicators may reveal gaps –
such as data on climate-sensitive exotic diseases – indicating where new indicators and data sources
may be needed. Indicators can be developed and tailored to a specific country or health authority
to monitor the pace, timeliness, effectiveness and sufficiency of adaptation efforts.
There is no ‘one size fits all’ set of indicators for climate change and health adaptation and resilience
building efforts. The objectives affect the types of indicators chosen. For example, the suitability
of specific indicators would likely vary for different objectives such as measuring: health system
resilience at global, national and local scales; progress on preparing for and managing the population
health risks of climate change; progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from health system
operations (e.g., health care, medical transport, medical products, infrastructure management etc.);
and measuring the effectiveness of adaptation in a changing climate. This document focuses on
indicators for measuring the climate resilience of health systems at national or local levels.
The levels established and information provided by an indicator should offer sufficient information
to inform operational decisions. For example, a ‘yes/no’ response to a question on whether a health
authority has conducted a V&A assessment does not provide information on when it was conducted,
which health outcomes were included, or which (if any) recommendations have been implemented
by the Ministry of Health at the national or subnational scale.
3.1 Criteria for indicator selection
Several criteria for indicator selection follow models developed for environmental health indicators,
but few are specific for climate change. Robust indicators for the climate resilience of health systems
include outcome and process indicators for all categories included in the ‘Climate resilience of
health system functions’ category of the Framework. This will allow health authorities to assess the
overall functioning of the health system when faced with a climate-related shock or stress. Process
indicators are suitable to monitor the overall effectiveness of the health system itself in preparing
for and responding to climate change. Useful criteria for selecting indicators relevant to a specific
jurisdiction include that they are:
 specific, based on an association between climate and health
 actionable, related to climate and health conditions that are amenable to adaptive actions
14
 measurable, based on timely and unbiased data of acceptable quality
 understandable, applicable and acceptable to stakeholders and potential users
 representative of the issues and areas of concern
 consistent and comparable over time and space
 robust and unaffected by minor changes in method, scale or data
 scalable, capable of being used at different scales
 cost-effective, capable of being constructed and used at an acceptable cost–benefit ratio
 sustainable, able to provide data for the next 20–30 years
The availability, accessibility, quality and resource requirements of data for monitoring indicators
often varies, suggesting that different approaches may be required to using indicators based on
available human and natural resources at local to national scales.
Every context is different; therefore, indicators should be developed based on the national and
subnational needs, level of capacity and the available human and financial resources. It is important
to link to and integrate with indicators used by partners, such as weather and climate data as well
as disaster preparedness. Indicators should be tracked, and analyses conducted of changes over
time, relative to a baseline through subsequent V&A assessments and other studies and monitoring
processes.
3.2 Selecting a first set of indicators
The first set of indicators can be selected through several processes. A team led by the Ministry of
Health should be designated to evaluate the current understanding of the health risks of climate
change. At the same time, relevant data should be collected within the Ministry and across healthrelevant ministries to identify a set of indicators for monitoring that will assess the resilience of health
systems across all categories of the Framework depicted in Figure 4. Many of these indicators will
already be routinely collected, so mechanisms will need to be determined for sharing the data at the
temporal and spatial scales needed. Data may need to be collected on new indicators – for example,
indicators that require modeling or analysis. The team will need to specify the data to be collected,
including the temporal and spatial scale, the process for collecting and reporting the data, and which
group(s) will be responsible for analyzing the data. A team responsible for monitoring the indicators
will need to be designated within the Ministry of Health.
For countries that have, or are conducting, V&A assessments, the indicators can be selected during
that process. Generally, the goal of the V&A assessment is to identify priority health risks and
adaptation options to manage those risks in a changing climate. These priorities, and the data and
information collected to inform the V&A assessment, can be used to select a first set of indicators,
which should include health system resilience.
The country could also consider data currently collected and reported in global monitoring
mechanisms, such as the WHO Health and Climate Change Global Survey, to help identify suitable
indicators. The responses to the survey signal areas of concern for population health and for the 
15
effective functioning of health systems. In all cases, it would be beneficial, whenever possible, to
align the selected priority indicators with key indicators reported in global monitoring mechanisms
or processes such as the WHO Health and Climate Change Global Survey. Organizing a meeting
of stakeholders responsible for the survey responses, including within the Ministry of Health and
across health relevant ministries, can facilitate discussion and agreement on which indicators are
priorities for monitoring health system resilience.
If no V&A assessment has been conducted, or if the country does not respond to the WHO Health
and Climate Change Global Survey, then a first set of indicators can be selected by the designated
team using the criteria discussed in section 3.1 for climate resilience of health system functions
and climate-sensitive health outcomes that are a priority for the Ministry of Health. The identified
indicators may come from research, a literature review, and/or expert or public consultation. The
results can be validated and expanded upon when the country conducts a V&A assessment.
Whatever the process for identifying the first set of indicators, the designated team in the Ministry
should explicitly outline a plan for continued improvement of the indicator set. As time goes on, new
data sets will become available that may be more relevant or at a finer scale – these data sets could
then replace those being used. As the climate continues to change, new indicators may be needed
for climate-sensitive health outcomes new to the country or that are increasing in incidence. Changes
in the geographic range of vector-borne diseases may mean that surveillance sites need to shift
with the new reality. And some health outcomes could decline with additional climate change, such
as where regions become too hot and dry for critical mosquito species. The designated teams can
adjust the indicator list based on new insights from updated V&A assessments and HNAPs. How
often the indicators should be evaluated ought to be specified in the plan for improving the indicators.
3.3 Indicators of upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability
The primary responsibilities for collecting data on the upstream determinants of exposure and
vulnerability lie outside the health sector. Therefore, it is important to link to existing efforts by those
partners to inform the monitoring of climate resilience in health systems. Selection of the indicators
to be monitored can be based on the results of the V&A assessment, HNAP, or knowledge gained
through adaptation projects. Discussions with the experts who collect and analyze the exposure and
vulnerability data would lead to a greater understanding of the strengths and challenges associated
with the data and could lead to the selection of different datasets. It may be possible that the data
owners could derive new metrics that better match the temporal and spatial scale of the health data.
Hydrometeorological services within ministries of the environment monitor weather, climate
variability, and climate change. Selected indicators should monitor current weather patterns relevant
for exposure pathways for climate-sensitive health outcomes – such as temperature, precipitation
and extreme weather and climate events – and should provide projected changes of these variables
under different pathways of greenhouse gas emissions. To ensure preparedness for a changing
climate, projections should extend at least to mid-century so that proposed adaptations can be
assessed against future climates, while still relevant to shorter health planning horizons. For health 
16
care facilities, projections should be through to the end of the century because of the lifetime of
infrastructure, although for some infrastructure the period may be shorter.
Ministries of the environment or other ministries and organizations also monitor environmental factors
and trends (e.g., air pollution) as well as socioeconomic factors and trends, such as demographic
change and economic growth.
Suggested indicators include:
 Temperature trends and projections until at least mid-century
 Precipitation trends and projections until at least mid-century
 Sea-level rise and projections until at least mid-century
 Trends in extreme weather and climate events and projections until at least mid-century
– Heatwaves
– Floods
– Drought
– Storm surge
– Storms
– Wildfires
 Trends in availability and quality of water and food
For vulnerability, selected indicators should monitor trends in factors that will affect exposure and
vulnerability to climate variability and change, such as demographic change (e.g., older adults are
more susceptible to heatwaves; children are more susceptible to food insecurity); economic growth
(e.g., to provide information on resources and allocations for adaptation); urbanization (e.g., could
lead to improved housing conditions or to unplanned settlements); and political commitment to
climate change.
As indicators for upstream determinants of health are collected in other ministries or departments,
developing memoranda of understanding or other agreements with relevant departments may be
needed to facilitate data-sharing and access.
3.4 Indicators of climate resilience of health systems functions
Based on the Framework, Table 1 lists sample indicators to measure health system resilience to
short-term risks (up to ten years) and long-term climate change impacts (ten years and over) for
each component of the Operational Framework. For some health system functions (e.g., leadership
and governance), the proposed indicators can be expected to be relevant for short- and long-term
risks (e.g., national strategies for health and climate change and/or HNAP, iteratively developed and
updated). For other functions (e.g., integrated risk monitoring and early warning systems), short- and
long-term indicators will be needed to facilitate effective preparation. For example, early warning
systems are often based on weather to sub-seasonal temporal scales, which means that indicators
of their effectiveness can monitor short-term resilience. For vector-borne diseases, longer-term 
17
indicators may be needed to track the rate at which vectors are changing their geographic range
and/or length of seasonal activities.
The assessment of health system resilience is qualitative and there are different levels of difficulty in
achieving the proposed goals (e.g., designating a climate change focal point in the Ministry of Health
could be easier than having a national health and climate change plan in place). For each indicator,
evidence-based quality standards (scaled by intensity/completeness of the response) and the dates
of report and periodic review should be established. Integrated monitoring facilitates the collection
and analysis of data on environmental hazards, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes.
The proposed list of indicators in Table 1, below, is not prescriptive; but it is a comprehensive set
that can guide countries to assess their health system resilience. Countries are encouraged to build
on this list, identify their needs, finalize their own indicators and develop their own targets that are
context specific (e.g., What fraction of the health workforce should be trained on climate change and
health? By when should all health care facilities be retrofitted to be climate-proof?). New indicators
can be fitted in one of the ten component areas. At times, it may be difficult to decide where any
one indicator fits best; this should not detract from the exercise of identifying additional relevant
indicators.
Building resilience in the short-term is equally important as building it over the long-term. Many
countries have already initiated short-term actions to prepare for the health impacts of climate
change; some of these may have important synergies with efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
While some may find it easier to identify additional short-term indicators, attention should also be
given to the long-term climate change risks that will require higher levels of resilience.

3.5 Indicators for population health and health system outcomes
Climate change and the upstream drivers of exposure and vulnerability are not static, requiring
adjustments as the drivers of risk change, with new risks arising and others being ameliorated in
response to the magnitude and pattern of climate change. For example, the geographic range of
malaria may expand in some regions with additional warming and may decrease in other regions
that become too hot and dry for Anopheles mosquitoes; it may also change due to the introduction
of public health measures to protect people. Additionally, although some health care facilities may
not initially experience the devastating effects of climate change directly, they can still be susceptible
to smaller incremental impacts that could accelerate and accumulate over time. Examples include
receiving patient transfers from facilities experiencing interruptions to the delivery of food and medical
devices from suppliers affected by extreme weather events, and cumulative economic impacts and
longer-term stress and strain on health care staff. This means indicators will need to be deployed in
new regions and potentially scaled back in others. Because the need to measure selected indicators
will change over time, there should be a process for regularly evaluating, modifying and sunsetting
indicators as needs change.
A starting point would be to monitor at least one indicator for each health outcome of concern
and key indicators of health system/facility impacts from climate change. The results of previous
V&A assessments may help in identifying the indicators; otherwise, existing research results and/
or consultation with experts and the public may be used. Table 2 gives examples of indicators to
measure population and health system outcomes.
Table 2: Sample indicators to measure population and health system outcomes
Population health outcomes

100,000 population per week or month
22

extreme weather events and disasters
Disruption to power sources (by cause)
Disruption to food and water supplies
Supply chains Supply chains resilient to climate impacts (local, regional and
international)
Health procurement considers environmental sustainability and
carbon intensity
Health workforce Impacts on health care staff (physical and mental)
Staff shortages
Patient care Shortages of medical supplies (e.g., blood supplies, medical devices)
Damage to medical equipment (e.g., electronic records)
Disruption to operations (e.g., cancellation of surgeries, transfer of
patients)
Impacts on quality of patient care
Number of times facility accepts patients from other health care
facilities impacted by climate-related events
Financing Economic losses to the health sector and health systems from
extreme events and disasters
23
The growing risks from climate variability and change, and increasing interest from development
partners, mean that many local actors are implementing adaption options designed by and for local
human and natural systems, such as mangrove restoration to reduce the vulnerability of coastal
communities to storm surges. Whilst most climate change impacts are experienced locally – such
as floods, reductions in crop yields or the spread of diseases – these localized impacts can have
national and international ramifications that require action beyond the local level. Local or regional
adaptation activities should be embedded within national adaptation and development plans, to
ensure that the adaptation options implemented directly or indirectly promote the achievement of
national development objectives. If adaptation actions to protect health are captured or documented
in another strategy – for example, in a National Adaptation Plan – the best way to measure health
system resilience may be by reporting through that Plan in coordination with partners outside of
the health sector. Actions in other sectors that adversely affect health may also require monitoring.

4 DATA SOURCES FOR INDICATORS
TO MEASURE THE CLIMATE
RESILIENCE OF HEALTH SYSTEM
FUNCTIONS AND OUTCOMES OF
HEALTH SYSTEM RESILIENCE
This section provides information on key activities and processes producing data and indicators
on climate change and health at the regional, national, and global levels that can support efforts to
measure the climate resilience of health systems using this Framework. Specific objectives identified
by a health authority will affect the types of indicators chosen. Measuring health system resilience
includes:
 Climate variability and change
 Upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability
 Climate resilience of health system functions
 Climate change-related health outcomes (health system and individual health outcomes)
Health and other ministries and organizations regularly monitor data and trends that relate to
indicators in these categories.
The data sources for the selected indicators will depend on the country or specific health authority
and must be specified. The indicator system should consider the priority issues raised in any climate
change and health V&A assessment and health components of National Adaptation Plans.
4.1 WHO Health and Climate Change Global Survey
The WHO Health and Climate Change Global Survey is a voluntary triennial survey sent to all
194 WHO Member States and a small number of Non-Member Territories (14). It is completed by
ministries of health in consultation with other health stakeholders, ministries and institutions. The
survey forms the foundation of WHO’s global monitoring of national progress on key health and
climate change indicators. The WHO Health and Climate Change Global Survey report and dynamic
data dashboard (14) summarize the survey findings. They provide a snapshot of progress on the
implementation of health and climate change policies and plans; identify evidence gaps; indicate
barriers to achieving adaptation and resilience priorities; and efforts to promote the health benefits
of sector-wide climate mitigation action. In addition to tracking global progress, national level data is
presented in the WHO/United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Health
and Climate Change Country Profiles (15). Ninety-five countries participated in the 2021 global survey.
25
4.2 Vulnerability and adaptation assessments at the population and
health system levels
Conducting a national or subnational V&A assessment at the population and/or health system
levels will provide information about current and future vulnerability to the health risks of climate
variability and change, and the policies, programmes and capacities of health systems that could
increase resilience (Box 3). The assessment outcome will provide information to identify, validate
and adjust indicators. In addition, assessment findings will provide information and data to help
populate many of the selected indicators when monitoring health system resilience, for example,
changes in vulnerability over time as the climate warms, the effectiveness of adaptation options,
and the functioning of the health system.
Box 3. Vulnerability and adaptation assessment
As part of its guidance on building climate resilience, WHO has developed guidance on
conducting V&A assessments (6). Its aim is to provide a basic and flexible tool for conducting
a national or subnational assessment of current and future vulnerability to the health risks of
climate variability and change. The tool allows countries to evaluate which populations and
specific groups are most vulnerable to different kinds of health effects from climate change;
to identify weaknesses in the systems that should protect them; and to specify interventions
to respond. A V&A assessment is a participatory process and builds on the core principles
of risk assessments, taking into consideration the unique challenges presented by climate
variability and change, to provide policy-relevant information for maintaining and improving
health systems in a changing climate.
V&A assessments aim to provide an improved understanding of climate-related risks to health
and health systems, and relevant and actionable recommendations for policymakers on how
they can strengthen health systems and increase the resilience of populations vulnerable
to the impacts of climate change. V&A assessments are not only about understanding the
potential implications of future climate change. They are about assessing vulnerability factors
that interact with climate that can be modified through public health and related interventions
to decrease existing risks to health.
4.3 Stress testing health systems to determine their resilience to climaterelated shocks and stresses
Desk-based stress tests can be used to assess the resilience of health systems to climate-related
shocks and stresses under projected climate conditions. A stress test posits, for example, an extreme
heatwave, flood or storm with characteristics outside the range of recent experiences. The exercise
moves beyond identifying likely challenges from exposure to the hazard to specifying policies and
measures that would result in successfully managing a more severe hazard in a future climate. Stress 
26
testing considers socioeconomic and political factors that can influence the extent of health system
vulnerability and factors that can affect demands on the system by impacting population health.
Stress testing exercises are designed to identify conditions under which it would be difficult for the
health system to maintain its essential function of providing services to protect population health
and manage climate-sensitive health outcomes, and to identify interventions that could maintain
essential system functions despite these shocks and stresses. These exercises focus on acute and
chronic climate-related events and conditions, including those far outside the range of historic
experience, that could directly impact health systems and/or climate-related events and conditions
in non-health sectors that can indirectly impact health or health system function. The exercise can
focus on one or more of the building blocks of health systems, with the aim of improving system
resilience, robustness, redundancy and coordination.
The results of a stress test can be used to identify critical indicators for monitoring to ensure
that capacity is being built in areas that need to be strengthened to handle weather and other
climate-related hazards in a future that will be very different from today.
4.4 National and subnational surveillance systems
Surveillance systems are key elements of health information systems. Monitoring and surveillance
systems / syndromic surveillance systems track illnesses, injuries and deaths and inform early
warning systems that protect health (e.g., linked to meteorological information). They help prevent
morbidity and mortality when the information collected is analyzed, disseminated and acted upon by
health authorities, stakeholders and the public in a timely and effective manner, taking into account
the multiple drivers of the health outcome of interest.
Departments within the Ministry of Health may already be tracking climate change-related health
outcomes, such as the numbers of cases of dengue fever or the numbers of diarrhoeal disease deaths.
Data can be collected on the impacts of some climate-related events on health care facilities, public
health laboratories and other infrastructure.
Multiple processes collect national and subnational surveillance data that can be drawn upon in
efforts to measure the climate resilience of health systems. Common surveillance programmes are
described briefly below:
The International Health Regulations (IHR) are a binding international legal instrument on WHO
Member States that aim to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public
health risks with the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. Countries are
required to report to the World Health Organization regarding certain disease outbreaks and public
health events. Building on the unique experience of WHO in global disease surveillance, alerts and
responses, the IHR defines the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events
and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public
health security.
27
In 2015, WHO developed a monitoring and evaluation framework tool, the Joint External Evaluation
(JEE). In addition to evaluating the capacities required under the IHR, the JEE and the National Action
Plan for Health Security contribute to the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction. The indicators, with the highest levels for each, are:
 Planning an emergency preparedness and response mechanism
– Based on updated all-hazard health emergency risk profile resource mapping, multisectoral
and all-hazard public health emergency preparedness and response plans are tested and
updated regularly.
 Management of health emergency response operations
– A health sector emergency response coordination mechanism and incident management
system, linked to a national emergency operation centre, have been tested and updated
regularly.
 Emergency response mobilization
– Resource mapping and mobilization mechanisms are tested and updated regularly.
WHO’s Early Warning and Reporting System (EWARS) is designed to improve disease outbreak
detection in emergency settings, such as in countries in conflict or following a natural disaster.
‘EWARS in a box’ contains all the equipment needed to establish surveillance and response activities,
particularly in difficult and remote field settings without reliable internet or electricity supplies; it
can serve roughly 500,000 people. EWARS is deployed during an emergency as an adjunct to the
national disease surveillance system. After the emergency, EWARS should reintegrate back into the
national system.
4.5 Global, regional and national monitoring processes
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, published by the United Nations
Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (16) was the first major agreement of the post-2015 development
agenda. The Sendai Framework works with the other 2030 Agenda agreements, including the Paris
Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the
New Urban Agenda and, ultimately, the Sustainable Development Goals. The Sendai Framework
provides Member States with concrete actions to protect development gains from the risk of disasters.
The Sendai Framework has four global priorities: i. understanding disaster risk; ii. strengthening
disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; iii. investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience;
and iv. enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to ‘build back better’ in recovery,
rehabilitation and reconstruction. There are 38 indicators within the seven targets.
28
Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include 17 goals and 169 targets.
SDG3 on good health and well-being includes goals with targets (each with indicators) relevant to
managing the risk of climate-sensitive health outcomes by increasing the resilience of health systems
or by reducing the population health burden when climate change is explicitly taken into account.
National governments are tracking indicators for all SDGs, many of which relate to the upstream
drivers of health and well-being, including SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG5 (gender
equality), SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG10 (reduced
inequalities), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG12 (responsible consumption and
production), SDG13 (climate action), SDG14 (life below water), and SDG15 (life on land) (17).
The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), in collaboration with the UNFCCC, is conducting
a global review of a core set of climate change statistics and indicators across drivers, impact,
vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation to promote linkage to both science and policy (18).

5 INTERPRETING RESULTS TO
INFORM POLICY
5.1 How to interpret the results of monitoring climate resilience in health
systems
Regularly monitoring the climate resilience of health systems will provide a wealth of information that
can be used in many policy and planning processes to prepare for climate change, both within and
outside of the health sector (see Section 6). However, given the complexity of interactions among
many upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability, the breadth of health system components
that need to be monitored for resilience, and the large number of climate-sensitive health outcomes,
a single quantitative resilience index or score will not likely be feasible to develop, nor would it be a
valid measure for decision-making.
Documenting and interpreting the results of monitoring efforts may instead be accomplished through
the application of complementary approaches:
 Broad consultation and dissemination of results with decision-makers, stakeholders and
researchers to obtain feedback and their interpretation of them
 Routine engagement with these partners to validate the findings, or specific components, through
heath system planning meetings, community workshops, V&A assessments or HNAP workshops,
health system performance studies, etc.
 Regular efforts to refine and adjust the indicators used and the data acquisition methods. Aligning
these efforts with the completion of V&A assessments and/or updates and evaluations of HNAPs
can be beneficial
 Recording the baseline measures of resilience to identify specific trends that indicate increases or
decreases over time and identifying an appropriate and accessible repository for this information
A useful way to record and communicate this information is through the use of a colour-coded table
(as proposed in Table 1) that shows whether specific aspects of health systems are in place to support
climate resilience (see example in Table 3). It would also show whether effective adaptation measures
that could increase resilience have or have not been implemented and/or trends hindering resilience.
30

Regular discourse and participatory engagement with many partners – health planners, health care
professionals, affiliated health workers, community leaders, Indigenous communities, researchers,
decision-makers in health relevant sectors and others – will support more accurate and appropriate
interpretation of the indicators; for example, when data about health system capacity and adaptation
points to an increase in resilience, but the burdens of specific climate-related health outcomes are
increasing. Knowledge translation activities involving many opportunities to explore, analyze and
discuss the results in multiple fora can help to elucidate critical drivers of risk, vulnerability and
resilience that underly the results. Engagement with partners will also provide valuable input about
how best to communicate the findings in a meaningful way to decision-makers and the public.
5.2 Informing policy processes and programme development with
indicators of climate resilient health systems
At the national level, the policies and programmes may require adjustment as the risks from climate
change increase, such as monitoring and surveillance of an emerging infectious disease that may
expand into a particular jurisdiction. Information gained through the regular collection of data on the
indicators presented in this working paper can be used to develop or adjust policies and programmes
to increase health system resilience.
31
Information about the status of efforts towards building climate resilience only helps to protect human
health if it is communicated in a timely manner to decision-makers, stakeholders and the public. A
variety of mechanisms may be used to share and use the results such as:
 health system strategic planning activities (e.g., planning tables and events);
 development of dedicated reports, briefings or scorecards on health system resilience;
 development of cross-functional teams and cross-training of staff (e.g., public health, health care
delivery, social services, climate services);
 annual subnational and national state of health reports;
 community health profiles;
 input to regular V&A assessments, HNAPs, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and
National Communications;
 community/region hazard risk assessments; and
 international and regional climate change and health monitoring and reporting initiatives.
The monitoring and evaluation activities developed as part of a V&A assessment will provide helpful
information for monitoring the climate resilience of health systems and should be used as a key
information source that is regularly updated with iterative V&As.
UNFCCC National Climate Change Adaptation Plan processes
National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) are a state-led adaptation planning process sensitive to gender
and equity considerations as well as broader national-level priorities (19). NAPs are an iterative
process inclusive to vulnerable groups that seeks to leverage the best available information (e.g.,
participatory processes, Indigenous knowledge, climate risk assessments, etc.).
NAPs aim to (19):
 take stock of available information and needs;
 address capacity and knowledge gaps;
 identify national priorities and climate vulnerabilities;
 identify and review adaptation options;
 develop implementation strategies; and
 monitor and review adaptation progress.
The processes used to develop NAPs, as well as their structure, vary from country to country.
However, all involve the identification and assessment of adaptation needs, which may be used
to rank adaptation priorities. As adaptation is iterative – requiring ongoing assessment of risks,
needs and opportunities – monitoring progress, setbacks and emerging trends is critical. The NAP
development process often includes the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework to
complement the actions identified in the NAP. Many health authorities develop HNAPs for their sector
(8) that are integrated into broader NAPs. These frameworks can serve as a tool to monitor progress
towards building climate resilience within health systems, and to determine when NAPs may require
updating based on changing conditions or progress made. As NAPs are often multisectoral, health
authorities can use them to gain insights on climate risks and adaptation progress in sectors that 
32
influence the upstream determinants of health (e.g., agriculture) and help identify opportunities to
achieve health co-benefits through intersectoral cooperation. Table 4 provides examples of healthrelevant indicators for specific components of the Operational Framework that were included in
NAPs submitted to the UNFCCC NAP Central Database.

6 CONCLUSIONS
In understanding risk as the interaction of climate change-related hazards, populations exposed to
such hazards and their underlying vulnerabilities, it becomes clear that there is a need to reduce
hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities. Reducing hazards is the goal of mitigation by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions. But current levels of action are insufficient and risks to health are
increasing; the inertia of health systems also means that climate-related hazards will continue for
at least several decades. Moreover, climate change increases the probability that health systems may
suffer catastrophic impacts that overwhelm responses. Adaptation focuses on reducing exposures
and vulnerabilities, but these may not be sufficient to counteract the impact of future climate hazards.
This is equally valid for people as for health systems.
In this context, as risks continue to increase, bringing more severe impacts for health systems and
health care facilities, countries need to understand when their health system can be considered
resilient, and, if not, then to understand what areas need improvement. Taking WHO’s Operational
Framework for climate resilient health systems as its base, this guidance proposes both a framework
and methods for measuring resilience.
The proposed framework for measuring the climate resilience of health systems – requiring the
measurement of upstream determinants of exposure and vulnerability; the climate resilience of health
system functions; and the outcomes of health system resilience – aims to respond to country needs
to prepare health systems for climate change. This is best achieved by identifying information and
indicators tailored to the specific needs of different health systems, as proposed in this guidance.
