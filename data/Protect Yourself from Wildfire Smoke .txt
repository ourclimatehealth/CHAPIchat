forest fire with smoke
Be ready to protect yourself against smoke and ash before, during, and after a wildfire.

When wildfires burn near you, smoke can reach your community. Wildfire smoke is a mix of gases and fine particles from burning trees and plants, buildings, and other material. Wildfire smoke can make anyone sick, but people with asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), or heart disease, or who are pregnant and children and responders are especially at risk.

Breathing in smoke can affect you right away, causing:

Coughing
Trouble breathing
Wheezing
Asthma attacks
Stinging eyes
Scratchy throat
Runny nose
Irritated sinuses
Headaches
Tiredness
Chest pain
Fast heartbeat
Be ready to protect yourself against smoke and ash before, during, and after a wildfire.
