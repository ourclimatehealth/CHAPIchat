 Welcome. My name is Sabrina Shankman. I report on climate change at the Boston Globe, and I'll be moderating today's discussion of air pollution and the brain. I'm delighted to be joined by today's panelists. Please introduce my Te Arce, President and CEO of Hispanic Access Foundation, Joe Allen, and Associate Professor of Exposure Assessment Science and Environmental Health, and the Director of the Healthy Buildings Program here at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. Francesca Dominici, the Clarence James Gamble, Professor of Biostatistics, Population and Data Science at the Harvard Chan School, and Mike Mark Weisskopf, the Cecil K. and Philip Drinker, Professor of Environmental Epidemiology and Physiology, also at Harvard Chan School. Thank you all for being here. A reminder that today all the speakers here are going to be sharing their own views. They do not speak for the school. And thank you all for being here today in the audience. Let's jump in. An increasing amount of evidence has linked air pollution exposure to poor brain health, including cognitive decline and mood disorders. Mark and Francesca maybe could start us off. What do we know about the connection between the air we breathe in our brains? Okay, I'll start off. Okay. Well, there is more and more emerging evidence that, especially long-term exposure to our pollution, increase incidents and progression of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's and other neurocognitive disease. The work I've been conducting together with many colleagues here at the School of Public Health are basically analyzing the entire National Health system, the Medicare and Medicaid claims. We've been following several individuals over time, at Renault several million of individuals over time, assessing their long-term exposure to fine-particular matter. And so very briefly, and then I can say more about it, but what we are finding from this study with enormous statistical power is that long-term exposure to fine-particular matter increases the incidence and hospitalization of Alzheimer's disease. It also increases the progression in terms of re-hospitalization of Alzheimer's disease. And also we are saying that among people, they are diagnosed with Alzheimer's exposure to fine-particular matter tends to increase the rate of hospitalization for all causes and also increase risk of mortality. Okay. Mark. Yeah, and I guess we're going to add some of my sort of biological perspective. I mean, I think sort of the exploration of air pollution in the brain is relatively new. It's newer than many other outcomes. And I think one of the early things that got people interested in thinking this might be going on was the wealth of data that exists already on things like cardiovascular effects of air pollution, which there's a lot of data behind on many levels. And the brain is frankly hugely dependent on the cardiovascular system. So if the cardiovascular system is affected, we think there could be impacts on the brain. And I think that started, that sort of was at the origins of the interest that maybe something's going on there. And we do know that that can absolutely happen. And that is one of the things that one of the ways the brain can be impacted through air pollution. There's a lot of interest now and it's an active area of exactly what biology is happening with these particles. But there's, you know, particles can generate sort of inflammatory immune effects in the systemic circulation that can get to the brain. There's some ideas that the particles can get to the brain directly, actually, not just through these secondary effects. And more recently, there's been a lot of interest on the idea that actually, when you breathe into your nose, you're smelling things because you've got neurons that are kind of sticking out in the world exploring it that way. And we now understand that some particles or aspects of particles can actually get transported directly back into the brain, so skipping the lungs in the cardiovascular system. So that's an almost more immediate route. But people have seen, you know, in like dogs from Mexico City versus a cleaner part of Mexico, you can sort of see effects that we believe to be the particle type effects going on in the brain and sort of evidence there that something is happening. But it's a very active area of research as to this very specific biology of what may be going on. But there are many things that could be happening. That's fascinating. We're going to ask a little bit more about that in a little bit because that is a really interesting area. But it's not just these kinds of effects that we've seen. I understand there's also a link to anxiety and depression from poor air quality and that that's shown up in school performance too. Joe, could you talk a little bit about the acute effects on cognitive tests that you've seen? Yeah, for sure. So, we actually had a program right here at the School of Public Health on a surprising link between air pollution and mental health. And our team summarized the findings that you see largely in, you know, kids. And we see air pollution linked with things like anxiety, suicide ideation, big studies of, and we see increases in pediatric hospitalizations related to psychiatric disorders linked to air pollution. My own work has been around indoor air quality. So another type of air pollution and cognitive function impacts. So we've done studies of, say, office workers where we've changed the air they were breathing. We introduced air pollution into their space. In this case, it was air pollution like off-gassing from dry cleaning and dry erase markers without them knowing in a double-blind study and then we test their cognitive function performance. And we see they perform worse on these tests and these tests are things like how do I seek out and utilize information in the world? How do I make strategic decisions? How to respond during a crisis? And that was in a double-blind controlled study. But then we did that same kind of study globally and we had about 450 office workers and the same thing. So we had indoor air quality and these cognitive outcomes and this will tie into the work here. We actually saw a link between PM2.5, so main component of outer air pollution and a cute performance on these cognitive function tests. So air pollution measured at your desk, most of which is coming from outside and these acute tests. So across all these dimensions, it was office workers, university workers, kids in elementary school, high school students, we see over and over the impacts of air pollution on the whole range, mental health anxiety all the way through higher order cognitive function. And Mike, you've seen something related to schools in it, right? Yes, we have talked to parents in high Latino populated communities and high exposure to particle matter, 2.5, it may increase the respiratory infections of children which can lead to symptoms like asthma and that can lead to school absences and it can lead to less participation in school activity and so it's definitely a concern that parents have. What about when it comes to mental health, Mark, you've looked at that a bit? Yeah, so yeah, we did one of the first studies in the nursing health study looking at PM and its relation to anxiety symptoms there. So absolutely, I mean, there's more of the focus is on kind of cognitive processing and for the knowledge, you know, economy, etc. But all the kind of processing in the brain that is underlying how you learn and remember and how you function on a cognitive level is basically the same for mental health scenarios and possibly there it's even can be considered more sensitive in a sense. So, you know, if you sort of disrupt the path, you know, what's going on in the brain, you can put yourself into, you know, bad brain states and that can either exacerbate underlying problems and this is a big issue of what is actually occurring. Is it an exacerbation of something that's underlying in there or is it actually, well, both is it actually contributing to a new development of something like that? Yeah, I think just to add to what Mark is saying from analyzing massive amount of data, we're also saying that exposure to greenness and so have been able to spend more time in green parks actually has a protective effect on hospitalization and progression of Alzheimer's disease. We have a look specific to mental health, these are mostly studied in the elderly, but it complement and it's consistent to what Mark is saying. Now we need to understand even better whether they access to the green space also means that there is less particular matter because you are in the park, but we are actually seeing an evidence that even with the same exposure to particular matter, if you are close to a park of your spending more time in the park, the adverse effect of particular matter on Alzheimer is lower than if you don't have access to green space. Do you know what it is about that access to the park that is causing? Well, we are not studying the mechanism we can't, so not really, but I think that that could provide some hypotheses or with additional biological mechanism we want to study that will inform that protective effect. But I mean we do have tremendous amount of evidence of a positive effect of spending time in nature, has a protective effect on mental health, so I think it would be, I would guess it would be similar mechanism. Interesting. Communities of color are often disproportionately exposed to pollution. Here is an example, more than 56 million Latinos live in the 15 worst urban areas with the most ground level ozone pollution. So there is a clip from a video that we are going to watch from the Hispanic Access Foundation. It is an interview with a woman who has been impacted by air pollution in Phoenix, Arizona. Hi, my name is Yada Marin and I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. So I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, specifically South Central Phoenix, which is the epicenter of pollution and factories. And as a result, I actually grew up having asthma and a lot of my cousins and my friends growing up did too. And so it was very frustrating as I got older to learn that that was a direct result of the environment that I grew up in, the parts that I went to. And because I was exposed to a lot of those dirty fossil fuels in that pollution from living under highways. And so as I've gotten older, it has really become important for me to do Latino advocacy, especially around public parks and outdoors and ensuring that our children and our community members have access to clean parks where they can step outside and joy our beautiful mother earth and not have to worry about having respiratory issues or being exposed to dirty fossil fuels and harmful fumes that can cause asthma. Hi, Ted. Can you talk a little bit about how the Hispanic Access Foundation has been working with Latino communities on air pollution? Yes, we have just started a long range program called El I de que respira most, the air that we breathe. And we've recruited citizen scientists from 12 communities who are members of our faith-based networks who have the trust of their communities. And they are, they formed a cohort, a learning cohort where they're connecting with their peers to talk about air pollution and also learning from experts in air quality. These leaders, the citizen scientists are using air quality sensors in their churches to monitor and report air quality in their communities and then they're entering the data into an online mapping, an online map. They're also helping to work with us to develop materials that are tailored to the needs of their communities who are primarily Spanish-speaking or immigrant communities and they're disseminating that information in a variety of ways from sermons at church services to film screenings and round tables to community workshops, radio and social media. And then they're also providing supporting community in making practical changes to help improve their preparation when there's bad air quality days like masking or staying indoors. And then very importantly, which is something Yada mentioned in the film is they are advocates. And so they're inviting elected officials, decision makers into their churches to hear their concerns and then they're also organizing in the community to really urge for policy change. So across the sites where you're monitoring what have you learned so far. The biggest learning is how little to no knowledge there is about particular, particularly matter 2.5. Just we're starting at zero in terms of the knowledge. People understand and are concerned and have been for a long time about the health and effects that they're seeing and what they're seeing in their community. But the understanding is just really eye-opening for them and makes them feel that urgency to take action. Yeah. I mean is there a lot known about those kind of racial and economic disparities when it comes to to this like what where's the research on that? I don't know if I'm just kind of, I don't even. Well, I mean we we we published a study in nature three years ago where we looked at the exposure to fine particle matter in the last 20 years by census track in the United States and look at chronic exposure by the percentage of underrepresented and minority in that census track and no surprising. Well, we so is that I'll do exposure to fine particle matter thanks to the Cleaner Act has been decreasing over time quite a lot actually. That's definitely an excellent news. But we did see that the disparities and so underrepresented minority, Hispanic, Latino, Black American consistently breed higher level of our pollution than white American. The other interesting thing is that that happened especially for Black American even when you stratified by socioeconomic status. So in the context of Black American we didn't look that that specific question for Hispanic population we should and we will but for Black American what we found which was very surprising to me that high socioeconomic status Black American breed higher pollution level the low socioeconomic status white American. So that tells you a lot about the systemic bias and racism. Why? Well, what happened is in this marginalized community there is less pressure and less attention to being compliance with the different EPA rules and we see that see systematically by the way there is a you know I don't want to speak too much about it but there is a different study that we're conducting right now on exposure to our pollution from cryptocurrency data mining which are not regulated in the United States and surprisingly not surprisingly where these data mining and cryptocurrency are building where are located they tend to always be located in the lower socioeconomic status or in represented the minority because it is not the local government and the pressure of the citizen and the knowledge to to fight back. That's like historic redlining factor and to absolutely absolutely and if I could add related that because all of this is absolutely true but one of the reasons why I understand the mechanisms of this stuff is important is that my suspicion is that at least one part of this is going to be a slightly more generic effect on the brain so it will produce inflammation immune response things like that that are generally perturbed the brain and had also some effect but so do many other things right so it's not necessarily that air pollution is specifically the thing that causes Alzheimer's disease right but I think it's giving us a picture into potential mechanisms they get targeted by lots of other stuff so on top of you know minoritized populations often having higher exposures to say air pollution they also as illustrated by that little clip you showed have exposures to lots of other things and so that can do all sorts of things we were just at a talk about the idea that maybe and this is one of the things we think there's a there's something called the blood brain barrier that is supposed to keep stuff out of the brain but you can inflame that and you can make that leaky and the more you're exposed all these things the worse that gets so it's it's not it's it's a double whammy of largely being exposed more to the very things but also to many things because these are the areas that you know aren't as regulated or people sort of let industry go and then you have all sorts of exposures like that yeah I think one other thing just to add to this and bring it back to my ties and your the work you're all doing is that there's really been a fundamental shift in the technology and it has led to empowerment and citizen science so it used to be you'd have an EPA air quality monitor you know a handful of them really around the country we have some sophisticated models but we've now put the power in the hands of the community to monitor for themselves and see what's happening and that's because relatively new advent of relatively low cost air quality sensors they're not scientific instruments but you can see pretty quick being put in the hands for what used to be tens of thousands of dollars now a hundred or two hundred dollars and people can measure the air pollution in their home in their yard in their community at the micro level like what's happening outside in my home not relying on some reporter other data so it's a real big shift because it's put the power back in the hands of people to say I can actually see make the invisible visible this is what's happening in my area don't need to see the study I can see the monitor and I feel it and I can see it so it's a real shift in terms of the power dynamics of who monitor who has the power to monitor and also to my taste point about you know making that connect that you were saying that it was surprising how people weren't connecting they didn't know about PM2 point that part of it is you don't see it right it is tiny I mean this is like many times smaller than a human hair and so to have a device like this that actually you know makes it a little bit more visually apparent to you in some way is one of the ways to sort of get a better understanding point and to your point Joe the have putting the power into the hands of community the community that lifts lifts us and breathes this is really important because they are the answer they're able to really speak about their experiences to elected officials decision-makers they they can really be a powerful support in helping to change what happens in their communities to what extent is there a relationship between citizen science and the work that you all are doing in the more kind of traditional sense of science is there a lot of conversation happening and collaboration I'll jump in first I think absolutely we had a really nice conversation over lunch about the overlapping work so my team right now we're doing a project out of Mahaina related to the wildfires and the wildfires long extinguish but the exposure to particles as things get resuspended during the reconstruction is causing continued exposure but we're doing it with community partners from there who know the landscape been absolutely devastated in terms of loss of life loss of property loss of community but they're able to they have the monitors they have the network they're they're trusted partners there's no way we can ever pull off this kind of work without partners like my team and we're not working with them on that project but it's very similar probably work on other ones after lunch conversation I'm sure but yeah that's it has to work like that yeah and that that collaboration is now easier to do because of the the tools that are available that are less expensive and more accessible and and these partnerships as well somewhat my work is as it's different different flavor I will not consider myself in any way someone expert in citizen science as well although I completely recognize the value and the importance I think the way that we are trying to do to try to inform the local community is to provide interpretable transparent and localize information so because we analyze and you know entire national care system and then you know air pollution data and claims data for all the continental United States for the last 20 years instead of just publishing once again research article is to provide actually easily access easy to access and localize data so then the local community can actually go on the computer and see what's happening in their own census track not only what's happening in terms of level of pollution but also to understand whether or not their community is a more a risk for certain disease than than others and then that's it's really providing an empowering tool as well as monitoring and reporting where are and we'll talk about that later where there are the most dangerous for example cold fire power plants and whether or not they're near their community whether there are other industrial facility they are they could have a versatile defect and so it's trying to provide the rigorous data so then we empower the community to speak sure so it's like a two way street absolutely yeah yeah you were talking before about how the clean air act has helped kind of eliminate some of the some of the major sources of pollution or at least mitigate them to some extent and the EPA recently approved stronger standards for suit pollution strengthening the annual health-based national ambient air quality standard for fine particulate matter how do you expect that this will impact air quality in the US going forward well it will have a huge impact and a positive impact because that's the law and so I've been I think that the revision of the national ambient air quality standard for context of the current safety standard for long term exposure to fine particulate matter is an annual average of 12 microgram per clubey meter and the bad end administration has recently announced that it will be lowered to nine national average of nine so three units which is a substantial is a substantial act in terms of making a more stringent you know I'm really proud to say that the the school in sorting with the harbor sick city studies and many of the study that myself and my colleague have a conductor have been instrumental in forming that the the rule is one of the I would say the biggest public health victor in in very long time so it's it's going to have a huge effect for the simple fact that by law the counties are all the different states will have to submit to the environmental protection agency a state implementation plan and they will have to say to tell the environmental protection agency if they're not in compliance with the rules so if there are no leverage or some approximation is higher than nine how they're going to get there how they're going to be in compliance and so what it means also it means that they will have to look very closely to their inventory with all the sources of fine particulate matter whether it's traffic where is industry whether it's natural gas coal fire power plants and then they will have to say how they're going to you know how they're going to cut that sources to be to be in compliance and so lower fine particulate matter less of a self-defeat and longer life for everybody so it's a really good fantastic victory but why nine why is nine oh that's a very good question so we we did we did the study in the New England Journal medicine that was like accelerated to get to inform the the rule and we look at the health benefit when you go from 12 to 10 to all to nine to all to 20 and so you know one one might ask well why not zero right so I think that zero is nearly impossible because there is always going to be some background the level of fine particulate matter the evidence that there are thousands of studies all around the the world none of the studies have provide evidence that there is a threshold or what that means is a lower level of fine particulate matter below which it's not a self-defeat so by the line is ideally you want it to get as low as possible as low as feasible in the study that we published we showed of course going from 12 to 8 will be the best especially for underrepresented minority because so now in that study we really want to look at the benefit not only on average for the population but also look at the benefit to for the different that represented the minority they want to know which to me it sounds like they try to be as aggressive as they can still being feasible right but there is not there is not data to point out that nine is the magic number and below nine that are not a very self-defeat so it's a compromise between the science and I would say the political landscape we love another that we can hang our hats and yeah and that well and to that very point it's slightly problematic me so I was on the panel that did that came up with this and and I this is really it's all about how the sausage gets made right so it's a bunch of people around the table and they're those arguing for it to be higher and they're those like me or are you for it to be lower and we battle over it and they settle on something but one of the issues is you know they that panel is not supposed to take economic considerations into account right so now somebody else does that at some point so that's another thing that plays in but to Francesca's point it is true the data you know you can go down lower and the data sort of I personally think actually it would suggest lower is also very protective but weird things happen like they want a number right and so when they look at studies they say well what was the mean of the exposure in that study and so that study much must be speaking to the mean and so I spend a lot of time in this panel arguing that there's a lot of great data that's not at the mean and it's below the mean and in fact if you only have the mean you don't have any kind of distribution so you can't show anything and it's things like that they were making arguments they actually tended to downgrade Canadian studies because they're not in the US but Canada happens to be cleaner so they have studies at lower levels but some people downgraded them because they're not American so you know I am grateful for the work that you contributed the new pollution standards will improve their quality and begin to address the injustices and inequities that have existed historically I you know I will say that the WHO's limit is five they suggest five surprisingly to me and I only noticed relatively recently that Europe is actually worse than us their levels are higher than we have but the WHO which is really supposedly just focused on how has come down the further we're talking about numbers yeah so our colleagues here have done amazing work and saved many hundreds of thousands of lives because of this effort to get the national and near quality standards from 12 now down to nine WHO is five and Francesca pointed out these are legally enforceable that's why they'll work do you know what the legally enforceable particle limit is for indoor air and workers not 12 not nine not five five thousand five thousand is the current legally enforceable limit for indoor particles there's a major disconnect because outdoor pollution penetrates inside with indoor sources of particles and yet for our workers the only standards OSHA standard it's grossly out of date so we're down at nine five twelve this is gonna have a we know it's gonna be a massive impact on 12 to nine what would it do if we lowered our worker limit from five thousand to something reasonable like war is a magnitude lower and we have national ambient air quality standards because of the work of my colleagues over decades we don't have a national indoor air quality standard so today we're talking about how does air pollution impact the brain I think all of us first thought is outdoor air pollution there's a whole of the world of air pollution it's indoor air pollution and our standards are nothing like what we've done in this or for outdoor air pollution or the successes we've had it's a major problem in public health and quite honestly in our regulatory structure how we think about air pollution as just outdoor air pollution why is that OSHA on its website says our standards are out of date acknowledge this and that's for chemicals and everything else we don't spend as much time thinking about the indoor environment not nearly the amount of resources we don't have a study like Francesco some millions of people a big study in my field I mentioned 450 people very different we don't we don't have these huge cohort studies we haven't done that this Harvard six city study follow tens of thousands of people for ten years we haven't done it to the indoor environment it's a loose collection of researchers scrapping for money really trying to do that uplift this research but that's you know it's just an out we don't think about it there's a regulatory issue who has regulatory authority of this EPA is outdoor they have guidance on indoor but no real regulatory authority so it's really OSHA is the legally enforceable limits for worker protection indoors doesn't count for your home either this is a real problem so yeah I mean I thank you to our think that's it's you Gisha I think that to what's what's the most important thing to do in that context is to identify what are the indoor sources that get to these extremely highly rated PM 2.5 I mean and they I would say in the green majority if it's low PM 2.5 outside there's going to be low PM 2.5 inside unless you know workers are working in a setting where this level of fine particle matter are really high so I think that that is definitely need you don't need to conduct a study like million people I think what you need to do is to identify sources of indoor pollution they lead to this high level of PM 2.5 indoor and then regulate it but it's well one of the one of the issues is yes in the work setting you can potentially think of regulations through OSHA but in your home you turn on your gas stove and Joe will tell you you're going to get a massive spike of particular matter so you know what what do we do with that if you're cooking you're stir frying something you get particles into 100 200 and depending on your ventilation or filtration it'll linger for hours indoors and so you have indoor sources you also have outdoor pollution sources and you know even think about what happens with outdoor let's say it's 12 my gram cubic meter outside and your building takes out half of that so it's six inside are you building did a good job but you spend 90% of your time indoors most of the outdoor air pollution you breathe happens inside most of the outdoor air pollution you breathe happens inside even with that reduction happening just because it's a time the amount of time so and then but we know we can design to get the solutions we can design places that actually reduce that 12 to you know virtually nothing if you have good levels of filtration good building design so we can lower that burden even further so you have you have a you know the indoor space are the biased but this is but we're talking about air pollution I think it's really important you have outdoor pollution that penetrates inside we're breathing it outdoor pollution inside plus you're inundated with all these indoor sources and then workers can have totally disproportionate impacts depending on you know whatever the they're doing where the particle levels can be in the thousands of microgram per cubic meter well it's you raise such an interesting point because you can think about things that you can't really regulate out of existence like wildfires yes right but you could potentially regulate say a building code to be more protective of people on the inside so and wildfires is something that I want to talk about because increasingly that's becoming a big story for us globally across the US and even here in the Boston area where we're starting to feel the effects of wildfire smoke in a more regular way including last summer so I mean what let's talk more about what people can do to protect themselves in situations when the air quality is bad and and my type what are you talking about that when you start out I think for communities the more we can equip them and with opportunities to learn about PM 2.5 and and how to and then help them to also create their own plans for their families and households about what is around them and and and what are the practical things they can do in indoors as well as outdoors like wearing a mask and and staying indoors if there's a wildfire or there's smoke in the air I think also communities want to be part of the solution so Francesca mentioned green space and parks communities are planting trees and and native plants they want that oxygen and so I think giving equipping communities with more information will help them be part of designing what those practical methods to protect themselves are do you want to talk some more sure I you know I think we actually it'll combine some threads about these low cost sensors and what to do with building and outdoor air pollution so in the wildfire blanket the East Coast Canadian wildfires the skies and the New York turned orange and so the level sit on with three four hundred right maybe even higher in buildings that weren't designed well have low levels of filtration we'd see 200 or 100 inside that's extremely dangerous but in buildings that put in enhanced filtration the exact kind of filters we're talking about all through COVID maybe people are familiar with the herb 13 filter higher we saw much level lower levels so I'll give this building as examples of wildfire smoke hit Boston first outdoor levels were extremely high in Boston indoor we kept it below the national ambient air quality standard because we have upgraded our filters to Merve 13 or 15 this capture about 80 or 90 percent of the particles we have the portable air cleaners right in here and we knew it was successful in real time because we deployed a real time air quality sensing network in our classrooms so not only we say hey we think the buildings operating correctly we can rely on the outdoor air monitors we had indoor air quality monitors that said yeah our buildings performing and actually we couldn't rightly reassure people that well the outdoor pollution is bad inside our buildings we're safe Harvard School Public Health is doing this Harvard Business School we just got the Harvard Health Clinics to put in air quality monitors I work with a lot of companies I do this up and down across the world at this point actually to measure indoor quality and then improve things like filtration as a protection against wildfire but also just everyday outdoor pollution so that's I mean it's fantastic and I think although it reminds us once again of the potentially inequity that we see with the consequences of climate change related to the bush right so Harvard we now bring clean air right and we have the ability to put expensive filter and we know because we are the expert so well as you know potentially very very well-off companies but what's happening in the communities and so we do know that as a result of greenhouse gases and climate change we're going to have this wildfire becoming more constant more common and more extreme and the day highly educated and people that are well off will be able to have access and purchase expensive filters what are we doing as a sentient time community to disseminate the information and provide the resources of the low income community that we know ready right now they're going to be affected are they going to have access to that filters and so I think also I have to say that being seeing the major tech company Amazon Microsoft Google they actually are stepping in to provide I mean you know classical partnership why Amazon I mean you know I'm saying that live that has older resources will not cost them too much to deliver and send free out filter to the low income community where we know we can tell them right now which will be the community that will be affected by the wildfire so I think indoor hair is important that we it's critical important and we can now have the tools to clean the hair indoor but we need to make accessible to everybody and all the you know the people there they can all right Amazon if you're watching yeah just as a warning we've got we've only got about three minutes left but Mark did you have anything you wanted to weigh in about this yeah well I wanted to this is sort of touching on another point that I would like to talk about the business of sort we talk about sources indoors and whatnot but this is also true outside it's a wildfires is an example of one source of PM but I think it's important for people to understand it I mean PM in particular matter 2.5 is simply stuff in the air it's whatever of that size and depending on whether you're in Boston or LA or Phoenix that's going to be different right I mean in on the coast it might have a lot of sea salt in it for example wildfires a very specific one this is an area that we're not as advanced in and partly because the models are not so that as as extensive to be able to say what what is actually in that particular matter because for the brain it's very important I mean you can have a part you can have a lead element you know Adam stuck to a particle that gets into your brain that lead will do something very specific something else might do something specific so knowing where they come from not only helps us understand a little bit potentially about what is really the most toxic factor but also how to intervene on a public health perspective because it's possible and a recent paper came out on dementia trying to do this looking at sources and they kind of said at least in this paper I think it's the first I'm not going to say this is the final answer and more needs to be done but they sort of targeted they said that the wildfire signal and agricultural PM was particularly related to the dementia subsequent dementia right so trying to figure out what piece of this is it traffic is it cold power plants is it wildfires now wildfires we can't do much about but they're particularly interesting because I mean there's massive heat generated there all sorts of even if it's in the forest strange things come up dioxins get produced things of that sort but more and more these wildfires are actually at the interface between forests and urban areas and now you're starting to burn homes and buildings and that's producing all sorts of different stuff so it's a very different gamish depending on where you are and part of I think where we need to go in the in the future is to try and pinpoint you know does it matter is it any of this stuff or the particular ones that are particularly relevant because that may tell us where to focus our efforts on the bench. I'm going to just queue up our last question rapid fire style because we have like one minute left if you could change one thing today to improve air quality what would it be let's go right down the line. Expand the number of citizens to scientists in the most affected communities. Nice I'm related to what Francesco is saying we were trying to change the standards the only way it benefits everyone everywhere is if the standards change we're changing standards for outdoor evolution we're trying to get the standards to be changed for how we design an operating building such that it's not who can afford a filter and they're relatively cheap but it's just that's the norm we shouldn't have unhealthy buildings just be the standards to be healthy buildings that's how they're designed and made and operated. Shut down all the cold fire power plants. All right. Lower the standard further. All right there we go. Well thank you all so much for this insightful conversation I wish we had more time but unfortunately that's it for today if you missed any part of the program you can rewatch it on the YouTube page have a great afternoon.
