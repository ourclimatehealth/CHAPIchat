WILDFIRE SMOKE FACTSHEET 
Children’s Health and Wildfires 
A Resource for Families
Health Effects from Wildfires 
•
Children who breathe in wildfire smoke can have
chest pain and tightness; trouble  
breathing;
wheezing; coughing; nose, throat, and eye
burning; dizziness; or other symptoms.
•
Children with asthma, allergies, or other chronic
health conditions may have more  
trouble
breathing when smoke or ash is present.
•
Stress and mental health effects of all disasters,
including wildfires, are serious.
Preparing for Wildfires 
• Stay alert to smoke-related news coverage and
public health advisories.
• Look up your local Air Quality Index (AQI) on the
www.AirNow.gov web site or sign up for air
quality alerts: http://www.enviroflash.info/.
• Improve the indoor air quality in your home.
• 
If you have central air, talk to your HVAC or
furnace professional about upgrading to a filter
rated “MERV” 13 or higher.
• 
Buy a portable air cleaner sized to the room it is
intended for and never use an ozone-
generating air cleaner. https://bit.ly/3bmu8Rb
• 
If cost or availability of portable air cleaners are
a problem DIY versions can be a good short-
term solution. http://bit.ly/DIY-air-purifier
•
Create a "clean room" in your home. Choose a
room with few windows and doors. More
information available here: epa.gov/indoor-air-
quality-iaq/create-clean-room-protect-indoor-air-
quality-during-wildfire
•
If your child has chronic health conditions,
discuss plans for wildfires with their primary
care provider.
•
Stock up on food, medicine, masks, and
childcare supplies before the threat of a  
wildfire.
•
Practice having children age 2 and up wear
small N95 or surgical masks, using what fits your
child’s face best. See:
pehsu.net/Wildfires_and_Mask_Use.html
•
Evacuation may be necessary. Plan for it and
prepare your children. (see  
HealthyChildren.org
– Disasters and Your Family: Be Prepared)
During Wildfires 
•
Keep children indoors with the doors and
windows closed. If you have an air conditioner,
run it with the fresh-air intake closed (recirculate
mode), if you can, to  
keep outdoor smoke from
getting indoors. Use your portable air cleaner as
well.
•
Keep the indoor air as clean as possible:
•
Avoid smoking and vaping
•
Avoid using gas, propane, or wood-
burning stoves, fireplaces, or candles.
•
Avoid natural gas or gasoline-powered
generators indoors.
•
Avoid using unnecessary chemical
products.
•
Avoid frying or broiling meat
•
Avoid vacuuming (unless vacuum has a
HEPA filter).
All of these lead to poor air quality. 
•
A period of improved air quality is a good time to
open windows to air out the house  
and clean
away dust that has settled indoors.
Summary of Key Points 
•
Children are especially vulnerable to
health effects during wildfires due to their
developing lungs and other factors.
•
Wildfire concerns include the fire itself, the
smoke and ash, and the chemicals from
materials burned and fire retardants.
•
Smoke can travel hundreds of miles from the
source of a fire. Pay attention to local  
air
quality reports, even if no fire is nearby
(www.airnow.gov).
•
If it looks or smells smoky outside or if local air
quality reports, health warnings, or  
 
the Air
Quality Flag Program reports that the air quality
is poor, wait until air quality is better before your
family is active outdoors.
•
Pay attention to announcements on the radio,
TV, or online about changing conditions,
cancelled events, or evacuation. Indoors, reduce
health risks by avoiding  
strenuous activities.
•
N95 or Surgical Masks: Children 2 and up may
be able to get some protection from wildfire
smoke from N95 masks or surgical masks, but
only if they are fitted tightly to the face. Your
child can use a mask safely if they can tell you
about any problems they  
have with the mask. If
your child is uncomfortable or says that it is
hard to breathe, take off the mask. Use masks
only for short periods where your child must be
outdoors (i.e., 
travel between home and school).

•
Humidifiers or breathing through a wet
washcloth do not prevent breathing in smoke.
When to consider Evacuation 
•
If you must travel with children, reduce smoke
in your vehicle by closing the car  
windows and
using the air conditioning in recirculate mode.
Do NOT leave children in vehicles unattended.
•
Seek shelter elsewhere if your family does not
have an air conditioner, air cleaner, if it is too
warm in your home to stay inside with the
windows closed, or if the AQI is high.
•
Environments with cleaner air might include
public clean air shelters, libraries, or malls.
Check local news sources or county public
health webpages for listing of such shelters.
After a Wildfire 
•
Before children return to an area affected by
wildfires, make sure there are: safe drinking
water; running electricity; safe road conditions;
structurally sound homes; and sewage, ash,
and debris have been removed.
•
Children should not be at a cleanup site, nor
should they do cleanup work. Fires may  
deposit
large amounts of ash and dust contaminated
with harmful chemicals such as  
asbestos,
arsenic, and/or lead. Fires can lead to other
hazardous conditions such as  
 
broken glass and
exposed electric wires.
•
Adults should avoid tracking contaminated
substances and ash on clothing and shoes
back to areas frequented by children (e.g.,
homes, cars). Remove shoes at the  
doorway,
wash clothing separately, and change out of
clothing prior to interacting with children or
returning home.
•
If your child has contact with any potentially
hazardous substances call Poison Control (1-
800-222-1222) or your local Pediatric
Environmental Health Specialty 
 Unit
(https://www.pehsu.net/findhelp.html).
Special Considerations 
•
If your child has any difficulty breathing, is
excessively sleepy, declines food and water, or
there are other health concerns, reduce their
exposure to smoke and seek  
medical help
immediately.
•
If your child has asthma, allergies, or another
chronic health condition they may be at higher
risk from health effects related to wildfire smoke
and ash. Follow your asthma  
action plan and
seek medical advice as needed.
