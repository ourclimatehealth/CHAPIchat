Executive summary vii
Executive summary
Climate change is increasing its negative impacts on society, including on health and health systems.
This calls for urgent action to build climate resilience. However, while delivering health services and
patient care, health systems are responsible for around 5% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally
per year, thus contributing to climate change. In order to effectively protect the health of populations,
health systems have the double responsibility of building climate resilience and reducing their own
carbon footprint.
This document presents the World Health Organization (WHO) Operational framework for building
climate resilient and low carbon health systems. This framework responds to the demands from Member
States and partners for guidance on how the health sector can systematically and effectively address
the challenges increasingly presented by climate change, while reducing its own contribution to climate
change. It aims to contribute to the design of transformative health systems that can provide safe and
quality care in a changing climate.
The framework’s goal is to increase the climate resilience of health systems to protect and improve the
health of communities in an unstable and changing climate, while optimizing the use of resources and
implementing strategies to reduce GHG emissions.
The framework’s objectives are to:
• guide health sector professionals, including through their collaborations with officials in healthdetermining sectors to understand and effectively prepare for the additional health risks posed by
climate change, through climate resilient and low carbon approaches;
• present the main health system functions that need to be strengthened to build climate resilience
and low carbon health systems, and use these as the basis for developing comprehensive and
practical strategies (e.g. national climate change and health strategy) and plans (e.g. health component
of National Adaptation Plan (HNAP) and healthy long-term low emission development strategies
(LT-LEDS));
• support the development of specific interventions that can be implemented by health systems that
address both the increased risks posed by climate change and progressive reduction of carbon
emissions, and the synergies among these actions; and
• support health decision-makers to identify roles and responsibilities to develop and implement action
plans for resilience, and low carbon pathways, engaging actors within and outside the health sector.
Implementation of this framework would help health organizations, authorities, and programmes to be
better able to anticipate, prevent, prepare for, and manage climate-related health risks and therefore
decrease the burden of associated climate-sensitive health outcomes. Implementing low carbon health
practices would contribute to climate change mitigation while also improving health outcomes. Achieving
these aims is an important contribution to universal health coverage (UHC), global health security, and
specific targets within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This framework proposes interventions
around the 10 components as well as indicators to monitor progress (Fig. 1).

1. Introduction 1
1. Introduction
Climate change will profoundly affect health systems and the efforts to improve and sustain human
health for decades to come. It is widely recognized as one of the largest threats and challenges to
human health and well-being and is jeopardizing the realization of universal health coverage (UHC) and
increasing the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. These impacts are projected to increase
as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise.
In the longer-term, the effects of climate change hazards will increasingly depend on the extent to which
transformative and regulatory actions are taken to reduce carbon emissions. This transformation is
needed across sectors, requiring a focus on the social and environmental determinants of health and
the roots of climate change. Key health-determining sectors need to integrate health in their decision
making and interventions.
The health system, in the context of all these challenges, needs to be reshaped in a way that continues
to provide safe and quality care to its population. It can play a leading role in this transformation by
implementing an effective sustainable and equitable approach to climate change and health, following
a framework that should be enabled and supported by a sustainable governance mechanism, with highlevel political commitment, and tailored to the national circumstances.
This document presents the World Health Organization (WHO) Operational framework for building
climate resilient and low carbon health systems. This framework responds to the demands from Member
States and partners for guidance on how the health sector can systematically and effectively address
the challenges increasingly presented by climate change, while reducing its own contribution to climate
change. It builds upon, and expands the scope, of WHO’s Operational framework for building climate
resilient health systems (1), which has been adopted and used by Member States, many technical
partners, and all WHO Regions, in countries and settings to support climate and health action. The
revised operational framework does not change the approach of the previous version but rather now
integrates low carbon sustainability considerations. Countries that have already implemented the 2015
operational framework may find some updates in this version across the different components relevant
to climate resilience and should build on their previous work to further expand their climate change
programme so as to simultaneously and synergistically promote interventions that continue to prioritize
building climate resilience while reducing their GHG emissions and overall environmental impact. For
additional WHO guidance and tools on climate change and health see WHO’s visual guide for country
support on climate change and health (2); the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health
(ATACH) Community of Practice (3); and the global knowledge platform for climate and public health (4).
The target audience of this document are decision-makers in health systems, including public health
agencies, and other specialized institutions. Specifically, this document is a useful resource to health
sector managers, public health professionals, and decision-makers to develop comprehensive plans,
develop project proposals and implement interventions on climate change and health. This is also a
useful resource for decision-makers in health-determining sectors, such as environment, food, agriculture
and nutrition, water and sanitation, waste management, energy, transport, urban planning, emergency
and disaster management, education, as well as Indigenous partners and civil society organizations.
2 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Furthermore, international development agencies, investors, international financing institutions, and
partners can use this framework to inform the development of a funding programme and requirements,
and structure the development of project proposals and investment cases for climate change and health.
Key terms used throughout this document are health systems, climate-resilient health systems and low
carbon health systems (Box 1.1).
Box 1.1 Key definitions
Health systems include all the organizations, institutions, people, resources, and actions whose primary
purpose is to improve, restore or maintain health. The goals of a health system are improving health
and health equity in ways that are responsive, financially fair and make the best or most efficient use of
available resources. Six health system building blocks together constitute a complete health system – health
service delivery; health workforce; health information; medical technologies; health financing; leadership
and governance (5).
Climate resilient health systems are those capable of anticipating, responding to, coping with, recovering
from, and adapting to climate-related shocks and stress, to bring about sustained improvements in
population health, despite an unstable climate (1).
Low carbon health systems are those capable of implementing transformative strategies towards reducing
GHG emissions in their operations, reducing short- and long-term negative impacts on the local and
global environment.
Climate resilient and low carbon health systems are those capable of anticipating, responding to, coping
with, recovering from, and adapting to climate-related shocks and stress, while minimizing GHG emissions
and other negative environmental impacts to deliver quality care and protect the health and well-being
of present and future generations.

2. Background 3
2. Background
2.1. Public health and environmental health rationale
There is sufficient evidence that climate change is affecting health in numerous ways leading to illnesses,
injuries, and deaths.
Health systems consist of all organizations, people, and actions whose primary intent is to promote,
restore or maintain health. The overall goal of health systems is to improve population health outcomes
in an equitable way without overburdening people with health care costs (7,8). Climate change threatens
this goal. As depicted in Fig. 2.1, health risks from climate change are many and varied and can include:
• increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events – such as extreme heat, storms, floods,
droughts – and air pollution, all of which can cause several diseases, put pressure on health care,
and disrupt livelihoods, especially in low-lying coastal zones, drought and flood prone areas, and in
small island States due to storms, storm surges, and sea level rise;
• disruption of food systems resulting in food shortages and volatile prices, and negatively impacting
human nutrition, well-being, and livelihoods;
• increase in infectious diseases, such as zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases;
• increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as malnutrition, respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases, heat stress, and mental health issues; and
• potential increase in risk of conflict associated with resource scarcity, population movements, and
economic factors that deepens health inequities.
Furthermore, climate change impacts are undermining many of the other social determinants of good
health (such as livelihoods, equality and access to health services and social support structures), thereby
increasing health risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and populations.
Health risks from climate change are disproportionately higher among the most vulnerable and
disadvantaged groups including poor communities, newborn and children, women, ethnic minorities,
migrants or displaced persons, older populations, Indigenous Peoples, and persons with pre-existing
health conditions. Many are affected by multiple risks simultaneously (1,9). Climate change also impacts
health systems’ operations through: damage to infrastructure; damage or loss of equipment (e.g. medical
devices and products); impacts on water, waste, energy and transport systems; disruption of supply
chains; and impacts on the health workforce. Consequently, the provision of health services is also
impaired (10,11).
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed many weaknesses in health systems globally, having a focus on access
to medical services, without capturing the broad determinants of health (12). It caused unexpected and
unprecedented disruptions to health systems, but climate change is expected to have much greater
consequences for countries, health systems and people (13). Climate change is already increasing
humanitarian crises where climate hazards interact with high vulnerability (14).
This calls for reimagining health systems, and the concept of “systems for health” captures this well.
These systems are ready to respond to both known and emerging threats, hazards, and risks; they
address social, economic, environmental, and commercial drivers of health that are critical to securing
and enabling healthier societies (15). 
4 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Health systems are not only impacted by climate change, but their operations also contribute to
environmental degradation including to climate change through their GHG emissions. Many health
systems have unsustainable practices related to water, sanitation, waste, energy use, procurement, and
supply chains (10). The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change 2022 noted that the health care
sector contributed to approximately 5.2% (or 2.7 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e)) of global GHG
emissions in 2019. The study also highlighted the large differences in health sector emissions by country.
Of the 37 health systems analysed, the country with the highest (per capita) health sector emissions was
50 times higher than the country with the lowest health sector emissions (16).
Some emissions responsible for climate change are also responsible for air pollution, which causes
approximately 7 million premature deaths per year globally (combining ambient and household air
pollution (17). To fulfil its mandate to protect and promote the health of the population they serve, health
systems should strengthen their climate resilience and lead by example by reducing carbon emissions
and demonstrating real progress in moving towards low carbon systems and benefitting health.
Currently, no health system is completely climate resilient or fully decarbonized, although globally,
health systems are advancing towards these aims (18).

As depicted in Fig. 2.1, climate change risks to health and health systems result from a combination of
multiple hazards, diverse vulnerabilities, and multiple exposures and exposure pathways. Furthermore,
the figure also depicts the impact health systems have on the environment and climate change. Health
systems actions should aim to modulate health risks by increasing resilience and reducing GHG emissions. 
2. Background 5
2.2. Policy context
Global awareness of the interconnections between climate change and health has significantly increased
in recent years. For the first time under the climate change negotiations process, the United Kingdom, as
President of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), promoted a health programme, in collaboration with WHO and other relevant
partners in November 2021. The COP26 Health programme included two initiatives to be implemented by
health systems, namely on climate resilience and low carbon sustainability. As a result, over 70 countries
have committed to date at the Ministry of Health level to these initiatives (19,20); Box 2.1.

To support countries in their efforts to implement the COP26 health initiatives, WHO and the United
Kingdom launched the ATACH in June 2022.
By joining the ATACH, health authorities can join the community of practice embarked in efforts towards
building climate resilient health systems, share information and experiences, request for technical
support or additional guidance from relevant partners, and learn how the operational framework is being
implemented in other countries (key resources are available at https://www.atachcommunity.com/).
The framework is a useful tool to implement the ATACH goals.

3. Applying a climate resilience approach to health systems 7
3. Applying a climate resilience approach to health
systems
Resilience can be understood as the ability and agility of a system to change and flex according to
circumstances, and continue to function under stress, while undergoing change. Resilience is about whole
system capacity and not just the absence of vulnerability. WHO defines health systems’ resilience as “the
ability of all actors and functions related to health to collectively mitigate, prepare, respond and recover
from disruptive events with public health implications, while maintaining the provision of essential
functions and services and using experiences to adapt and transform the system for improvement” (21).
Adaptation to climate change and climate resilience building are closely related, but not synonymous.
Adaptation is the “process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems,
adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human
intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects” (22). WHO defines climate
resilient health systems as “those that are capable of anticipating, responding to, coping with, recovering
from, and adapting to climate-related shocks and stress, to bring about sustained improvements in
population health, despite an unstable climate” (1).
A conceptual framework for climate resilience in health systems is shown in Fig. 3.1. The degree of
resilience that a system possesses is a function of the strength of the hazard, the current vulnerabilities in
the system and the extent of exposures. The health system capacity level (left axis) is a key determinant
of the impacts of a shock or stress in the system. Low levels of resilience may result in the system
collapsing (health operations cease) or experiencing setbacks (limited health service delivery capacity
due to stock losses or staff shortages) that put them in a worse position than before the adverse events.
Resilience is not just about responding to shocks or stresses to the system. Health systems can also
learn from previous experiences and put in place interventions to recover, which can be at the pre-event
state or better, achieve a transformation which would lead health systems to be able to anticipate, and
promptly respond to increasing and more diverse threats posed by climate change (10).

8 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Building health system resilience to climate change is a cumulative and iterative process. It begins with
making resilience a goal, while improving population health, ensuring an adequate health and care
workforce, being responsive and efficient with an iterative management approach and providing social
and financial protection.
Governments and communities can protect public health from climate change-related risks. A healthier
population and stronger health system will be more resilient to climate change. Building climate resilience
in health systems is a process to adapt more effectively to changing health risks due to climate change.
The process to building climate resilience occurs in two principal ways:
• reducing climate-related health risks (including hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities), and
• developing specific health system capacities, integrating climate perspectives to health policy and
operations (Box 3.1).
Box 3.1 Overarching considerations in building climate resilience
Manage climate-related health risks
Managing risks in health systems related to climate change is needed to reduce climate-related health
risks and create health systems’ resilience and healthier populations that can respond to, and be protected
from, health impacts from climate change. This includes preparing and responding to current and future
hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities.
Develop health system capacity
To prepare a health system to promptly respond to climate change risks it would be necessary to
address current gaps, improve the current health system or programme performance, and to adapt the
infrastructures, technologies, and supply chain of health facilities. Furthermore, health systems should
increasingly take steps to understand, plan and respond regarding how climate change will affect their
population and their operations for delivering health services, and to enhance their institutional capacity
accordingly. This entails building capacity to: recognize, monitor, anticipate, communicate, and prepare for
changing climate-related health risks; prevent, respond to, manage, and cope with uncertainty, adversity,
and stress; adapt operations to changing risk conditions; use climate and weather information to adapt
the way health is delivered; recover from crises and setbacks with minimal outside support; and learn
from experience to improve system capacity for the future.
Long-term vision and adaptative management
Climate-related health risks can occur at multiple timescales, from short-term climate variability (such as
extreme heat and storms that can trigger health emergencies and disasters over timescales from days to
weeks) to long-term climate change (such as timing of the onset of seasons and average number of hot
days and nights over decades). Globally, the number of reported extreme weather events is increasing,
and these trends will increase the risk of climate-related adverse impacts to humans and health systems,
which will bring new challenges and costs. A future challenge for health authorities is that health
adaptation will become progressively more difficult (because of increased impacts, complexity of impacts,
increased demands for action, competition for resources, etc.). The implementation of interventions
should therefore consider a structured and iterative process of decision-making with the aim to improve
health service delivery and health system performance in the short- (weeks to few years), medium-
(5–10 years) as well as long-term (decades) perspectives. It is important to monitor changes in climate
and health risk trends over time to ensure adaptive management approaches that can reduce uncertainty
and adjust the health system according to changes. There is also a need to foster new long-term and
sustainable models of specific climate change funding streams and to mobilize additional resources into
health policy funding mechanisms.
3. Applying a climate resilience approach to health systems 9
Promote whole-of-society action
Bringing together evidence and actions across the whole-of-society, including the health sector, healthdetermining sectors, and communities, it is necessary to enhance responsiveness and resilience in health
systems. Local communities should be made aware of the complex reality of climate change risks and
their effects on their health and well-being. Local level dialogue, two-way information exchange, and
community mobilization should be considered as essential functions of the health system. Community
empowerment can activate local capacity, increase the scope of available information, improve
understanding of vulnerability, and build foundations for local resilience.

4. Applying a low carbon approach to health systems 11
4. Applying a low carbon approach to health systems
Demand, interest, motivation, and opportunities to cut GHG emissions in every sector and across society
are increasing rapidly.
As recognized by the UNFCCC and enshrined in the Paris Agreement, countries have common but
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in their response to climate change (26). This
principle acknowledges the unequal distribution of the causes and impacts of climate change worldwide,
as well as the right to development of high-quality health systems. Health systems with a higher level of
per-capita emissions have a responsibility to decarbonize more rapidly, beginning in the 2020s. Health
systems in countries with lower historical contributions to global emissions should be supported to
maximize health system performance and achieve climate resilience, as well as minimize their own
emissions.
Taking action to reduce emissions can deliver significant cost savings – for example through reduced
electricity and fuel costs, or more efficient use of resources – and lead to large and immediate health
co-benefits for patients – for example by reducing new asthma cases, or minimizing exposure to local
air pollution (27).
In settings where emissions are low, efforts to reduce emissions should not be made at the expense
of protecting health. Thus, actions to support progress towards decarbonization need to focus on both
optimal health and reduced GHG emissions (16).
While the health sector is not among the sectors responsible for most of the emissions, it is a substantial
contributor to GHG emissions. Although the bulk of these emissions is in highly developed countries,
this is changing rapidly as economies grow with reliance on fossil fuels.
Health care systems are responsible for approximately 5% of global emissions, mainly due to energyintensive production and transportation of supplies, energy consumption, transportation, and waste
treatment. These sources of emissions are often categorized by ‘scope’ as defined by The Greenhouse
Gas Protocol (28). Standards to measure and manage GHG emissions are described in three “Scopes”:
• Scope 1 are direct emissions from health owned or directly controlled sources (on site);
• Scope 2 are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (mostly electricity);
• Scope 3 are other indirect emissions from production and transportation of goods and services, which
include all domestic and international supply chains and end-of-life disposal.
Carbon footprint assessments are conducted with diverse tools which aid in understanding the current
sources of GHG emissions from each health system. These may be used as a first step to determining
the scale of current emissions by source and can highlight areas to target for emissions reduction.
Where sufficient capacity and data are available, health systems should develop improved estimates
of emissions through a combination of ‘top-down’ and/or ‘bottom-up’ approaches (Box 4.1). The first
estimates developed will be limited by data availability. However, improving carbon analytics’ capability
over time will help to calculate emissions with more precision.
12 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Box 4.1 Different approaches to estimate carbon footprint of health systems and
facilities
‘Top-down’ approaches estimate the carbon footprint of the whole health sector (total GHG emissions,
often presented as a fraction of national GHG emissions). This approach responds to questions such as
What fraction of all GHG emissions in a country are from the health sector? Where do these emissions
originate from? and What are the high-level sources of emissions in the health system? These estimates
are typically based on aggregate measures such as total population or health care expenditure. Topdown approaches guarantee breadth of coverage but are less useful for precision or tracking changes
over time. Published estimates comparing different health systems’ emissions are typically based on topdown methods.
‘Bottom-up’ approaches are based on counting activities across a health system (such as units of electricity
used, or number of inhalers prescribed) and assigning an average GHG value (‘carbon factor’) to each
activity. The sum of these activities can be combined towards a total footprint. Bottom-up approaches
can also add emissions of different health facilities to national databases. These approaches offer the
ability to track changes in emissions over time and a much more detailed picture of what activity is
producing emissions in different parts of the health system. A pure ‘bottom-up’ approach will be limited
by the activity data available and cannot offer 100% coverage. These approaches can help respond to
more specific questions, such as How many emissions did a specific health facility generate from diesel
combustion? or What were the emissions savings compared to last year after installing energy-efficient
LED lighting?
Hybrid approaches combine the breadth of a top-down approach with the detail and insight of a bottomup approach. A hybrid approach is likely to be the most suitable approach for improving an estimate of
health system emissions over time. Over time, health systems should aim to integrate more bottom-up
data into their footprint estimates. One such example is the NHS Carbon Footprint Plus model (29) that
has been developed over several years and continues to replace ‘top-down’ estimates with new sources of
‘bottom-up’ activity data. These approaches are shown in Fig. 4.1, and the chart to the right shows a typical
proportion of emissions from each Scope.

Even when countries are not able to assess their emissions due to lack of data or resources, they can
implement several low regret interventions that will bring benefits in terms of climate resilience, low
carbon sustainability, or both, and ultimately to the health of the populations they serve. Furthermore,
estimations of emissions from health systems by Scope helps to understand where the key hotspots
are and therefore inform low regrets interventions. Even in the absence of analytical capabilities and
emissions estimates, some interventions can already be implemented to generate environmental,
health, economic and/or social co-benefits. Relevant tools and guidance can be accessed in the ATACH
Community of Practice (3). 

5. Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 15
5. Operational framework for building climate resilient
and low carbon health systems
5.1. Goal and objectives
Framework’s goal and objectives
The framework’s goal is to increase the climate resilience of health systems to protect and improve the
health of communities in an unstable and changing climate, while optimizing the use of resources and
reducing GHG emissions. The framework addresses these two areas in an integrated manner leading to
increased preparedness for current and future climate change risks and impacts, potential cost savings,
and contributing to slowing down climate change.
Health systems should be increasingly strengthened and continue to be efficient and responsive to
improve health, increase capacity, reduce inequities and vulnerability, and provide adequate social and
economic welfare, considering the shocks and stresses posed by climate change. This must be done in an
equitable, responsible, financially fair way with efficient use of available resources and delivery of health
services. The framework aims to achieve its goal by proposing specific functions that, if implemented by
health systems, will contribute to building their capacity to effectively monitor, anticipate, manage, adapt
to, and help reduce the health risks associated with climate variability and change while minimizing its
own environmental impact and GHG emissions.
The framework’s objectives are to:
• guide health sector professionals, including through their collaborations with officials in healthdetermining sectors to understand and effectively prepare for the additional health risks posed by
climate change, through climate resilient and low carbon approaches;
• present the main health system functions that need to be strengthened to build climate resilience
and low carbon health systems, and use these as the basis for developing comprehensive and
practical strategies (e.g. national climate change and health strategy) and plans (e.g. health component
of National Adaptation Plan (HNAP) and healthy long-term low emission development strategies
(LT-LEDS));
• support the development of specific interventions that can be implemented by health systems that
address both the increased risks posed by climate change and progressive reduction of carbon
emissions, and the synergies among these actions; and
• support health decision-makers to identify roles and responsibilities to develop and implement action
plans for resilience, and low carbon pathways, engaging actors within and outside the health sector.
5.2 The operational framework and how to use it
Health systems vary around the world, but they all share common features in their ultimate goals and
key functions. WHO has identified six building blocks that are common and relevant to all health systems,
and are needed to support the delivery of UHC and improve health outcomes. These are: (i) leadership
and governance; (ii) health workforce; (iii) health information systems; (iv) essential medical products and
technologies; (v) service delivery; and (vi) financing (7). For the whole health system to become climateresilient and have low carbon pathways, each of its six independent building blocks must integrate
climate change considerations. To provide a comprehensive health response to climate change risks and 
16 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
protect people’s health and health systems, this new framework proposes 10 components or functions –
linked to the six building blocks – that when implemented by health systems would get translated into
increased climate resilience and reduced GHG emissions (Fig. 5.1).
Fig. 5.1. Operational framework for climate resilient and low carbon health systems
The framework components should be used to mainstream climate change into sector wide and/or
vertical programmes, as well as guide the holistic design of policies, plans and strategies aiming to
strengthen climate resilience and/or reducing GHG emissions and environmental impacts of health
systems (e.g. HNAP, health in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (31), health in the LT-LEDS).
Each component plays an important role in promoting an integrated approach to climate resilience and
low carbon sustainability. As a systemic approach, there are strong connections between the various
components that serve to reinforce one another. The framework is not to be used as a definitive and
rigid structure, but as a flexible and iterative approach that should be adapted to the national and local
context.
By implementing the 10 key components laid out in this framework, health organizations, authorities and
programmes will be better able to anticipate, prevent, prepare for, and manage climate-related health

risks while implementing environmental sustainability including low carbon health practices, thereby
improving health outcomes. Achieving these aims is an important contribution to UHC, global health
security, and specific targets within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Countries and partners using the previous (2015) operational framework will find that the current edition
follows the same approach, integrates few updates regarding the proposed interventions for building
climate resilience, and lays a new focus to simultaneously act on reducing GHG emissions. Thus, work
performed up to now is a strong base to further expand climate change action by health systems.
The framework is useful to inform more focused action in health care facilities
Specific guidance providing interventions for strengthening the climate resilience and environmental
sustainability in health care facilities (10) and assessing vulnerability of health care facilities in the
context of climate change (11), is available for health facility managers and the overall health sector.
Under the overall health system’s framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems,
the specific health care facility guidance focuses in four fundamental requirements for providing safe and
quality health care in the context of climate change. These are: (i) health workforce; (ii) water, sanitation,
hygiene, and health care waste management; (iii) energy; and (iv) infrastructure, technologies, products
and processes. Fig. 5.2 shows how the broader health systems relate to action at health care facility level.

5.3. Different pathways for building climate resilient and low carbon health
systems in an integrated manner
As health systems are faced with increasing threats from climate-related hazards, and direct climate
change impacts, the future of health systems and health services need to be based upon complete
systems transformation, through collaboration within and across all sectors (19,32).
For the purposes of suggesting specific pathways for health systems to follow in their efforts to build
climate resilience and decrease their emissions, the WHO proposes an approach that considers the UHC
index (available for all WHO Member States) and the health sector per capita GHG emissions (currently
available for about a third of all countries (33). Furthermore, information on the climate change and
health capacity of a selected number of countries based on WHO collected data (rated as high, medium 
18 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
and low) is provided (currently available for about half of all countries). This information was established
using the data available in WHO’s global survey on climate and health and was structured using an
indicator for each of the building blocks of health systems (34).
The UHC index gives a measure of the overall level of performance of the health system, and underlines
the centrality of high-quality, equitable health systems in protecting against all health risks, including
those affected by climate change. The climate change and health capacity index aim to capture the
additional steps that countries should take specifically to address the evolving health risks from climate
change, and which can be implemented irrespective of the overall level of the UHC. The health sector
per capita GHG emissions represent the impact of the health system on the climate, to guide countries
to limit emissions, without compromising – and ideally enhancing the delivery of UHC and climate
resilience (Fig. 5.3).

Sources: References 33–35.
The pattern that emerges is one of large differences in the different dimensions represented in Fig. 5.3. All
sectors within countries need to reduce their GHG emissions. For the health sector, some countries with
currently very high health sector GHG emissions need to urgently reduce emissions without sacrificing 
5. Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 19
quality of care, including climate resilience, while others with currently low health sector GHG emissions
need to focus on strengthening the overall performance and specific climate resilience of their health
systems; as a process towards a low carbon future with equity.
Based on Fig. 5.3, Fig. 5.4 helps to determine the baseline and targets for climate resilience and GHG
emission reductions for health systems. Although health sector GHG emissions data is limited to around
a third of all countries, it may still be possible for countries without such data to estimate where they
are within broad categories of low, middle, or high health sector emissions. Considering a study (33)
that produced data for 64 countries which comprised over 89% of global gross domestic product (GDP),
it is reasonable to assume that many of the remaining countries, absent from Fig. 5.3 and currently
without data, would have low or medium health sector GHG emissions. Fig. 5.4 shows the different
pathways countries can follow to maximize health system performance, including climate resilience,
while minimizing GHG emissions.

There are at least five baseline situations and proposed pathways for countries. These are summarized

5 High High Focus on achieving net zero emissions while

Target High Low Net zero emissions and climate resilience by 2050
Note: For health system performance, high is preferable. For health sector GHG emissions, low is preferable.
The proposed pathways recognize that, although all health systems should be moving to low carbon
pathways, in some cases they may temporarily increase their emissions to ensure quality of care. As an
example, at least one billion people globally are served by health facilities without reliable access to
electricity (36). Therefore, countries in area 1 (Fig. 5.4), which are not able to immediately adopt renewable
energy, need to minimize growth in GHG emissions, thus ensuring their health system provides quality
care, before reducing their emissions within for example, the next decade.
Countries can begin to assess where they find themselves in terms of both dimensions, by obtaining data
already prepared, or estimating their own, where none are available. For health system performance,
WHO produces several useful indicators, including the UHC index and health-adjusted life expectancy
(HALE), and the WHO/UNFCCC country profiles on health and climate change (37). Availability of health
GHG emission data for whole health system assessments is a constraint for some countries. However, it is
not necessary to estimate current sector emissions quantitatively, as qualitative assessments are useful.
Countries in areas 1, 2 and 3 have the opportunity to continue strengthening their climate resilience
while adopting low carbon technologies and implementing low regret interventions for decreasing their
emissions (e.g. greener waste management practices, energy efficiency measures). These low regret
interventions make sense from an economic, social, and environmental perspective.
Countries in area 4 and particularly area 5, on the other hand, need to make rapid transformations to
reduce their GHG emissions and ideally, reach net zero emissions by no later than 2050.
In every case, the aim of the proposed pathway is to reach the target of a climate resilient and low carbon
health system (green area) responding to the needs of countries across different levels of development.
All health systems can eventually reach net zero emissions, and many should target to do this before
2050 (blue area).
6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 21
6. Framework components for building climate
resilient and low carbon health systems
Climate-transformative leadership
and governance
COMPONENT 1
Overview
This component addresses the importance of strong leadership and governance for climate resilience,
low carbon pathways, and environmental sustainability in health systems. It is implemented through
ensuring specific governance for climate change and health; developing health policies and programmes
that integrate climate change considerations; ensuring that health is integrated in climate change
processes, policies, and plans; and cross-sectoral collaboration to protect health from climate change.
Together these functions provide an enabling environment required for coordinated actions on climate
change and health.
At the health system level, political leadership, and willingness at the highest levels within the
government to address the health risks of climate change and to reduce emissions are essential to
ensure the integration of climate change considerations by all health programmes. This includes
strengthening collaboration across all relevant health programmes, such as environmental health;
epidemiological surveillance; vector and zoonotic control; water, sanitation and hygiene; mental health
and NCDs; maternal and newborn health; health care waste management; air quality surveillance;
chemical surveillance; preparedness and management of disasters; health information systems; health
workforce and human resources; pharmaceuticals, technologies, infrastructure and the supply chain;
and operation and delivery of health services.
At the same time, an effective response to climate change implies assessment, monitoring, regulation,
and management of climate-related health risks that originate in other sectors. These sectors include
agriculture and food; water; waste; energy; transport; labour and industry; land planning; housing and
infrastructure; and emergency and disaster risk management. In most countries these sectors have
active programmes to respond and adapt to the impacts of climate change, however few integrate
health considerations within those. Cross-sectoral collaboration will help reduce unintended risks
to health and achieve large and immediate health co-benefits associated with the climate change
adaptation and mitigation policies and programmes of those sectors. It will also increase the resilience
of systems and services that support the operation of the health system (e.g. transport, food, water,
energy, pharmaceuticals, medical devices) (23).
Cross-sectoral collaboration also refers to ensuring that partnerships required to warrant whole-ofsociety actions on climate change and health are implemented. Health sector participation on national
or subnational climate change committees or participation by officials from health determining sectors 
22 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
in climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments can support cross-sectoral
collaboration.
Accountability is an integral part of health governance and of effective and efficient health system
functioning. It requires engagement with, and accountability to the wider communities that are affected
by the decisions taken on their behalf, on the provision of affordable health services for all, ensuring
equity, quality and efficient people-centred care and healthy communities in a changing climate.
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Governance – Specific responsibility and accountability mechanisms on climate change and health
established within the Ministry of Health.
Policy development – Climate change considerations, both for resilience and low carbon sustainability,

24 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Climate-smart health workforce
COMPONENT 2
Overview
The health workforce is key to building climate resilience and environmental sustainability of health
systems. This component refers to: fortifying the health and care workforce to respond to climate-related
health risks; the promotion of a fit-for-purpose health and care workforce with competencies and a
conducive working environment in health systems to manage climate threats, and to reduce its own
GHG emissions; and providing actionable information and communication to work with communities
and health-determining sectors in the context of climate change and health.
A health system relies upon an effective health workforce to achieve the best health outcomes possible,
given available resources and circumstances. Climate change may increase local demand for health
services, thus potentially altering the number of health workers required, the skills mix of health workers
needed, as well as their competencies. The availability of the required health and care workforce with the
required capacity to act on climate change and health is a fundamental determinant of overall climate
resilience as it strongly predicts the capacity of health systems to provide health services in a changing
climate. Information, and technical and professional capacity of the health workforce, including health
and care workers, cleaners and waste handlers, administrative personnel, managers and decision-makers,
and community-based organizations, should be strengthened in a way that they are able to deal with
the health risks from climate change while leading the reduction of GHG emissions and contributing to
overall decreased environmental impacts in their respective areas of work.
Health workforce competencies can be developed through pre-service education, lifelong learning, and
mentoring. Skills required include understanding and using climate information for health interventions
and decision-making; engaging in cross-sectoral action; conducting research, assessments, and
interventions; and effectively managing climate change risks to health and health system performance.
In addition, a range of competencies would become increasingly important in the face of climate
change, such as the ability to effectively work and communicate across disciplines, with health actors
and the public, as well as analytical skills to interpret and use non-health information for decisionmaking. Increased health workforce capacity will help health systems to respond to risks associated
with climate change, measure its carbon footprint, and promote innovative transition to low carbon or
net zero emission systems, and become environmentally sustainable.
In addition to strengthening the technical and professional capacity of the health workforce, it is
also strategically important to strengthen the organizational capacity to implement climate change
and health actions both for resilience and low carbon sustainability. This includes modifying existing
policies, programmes, and activities; ensuring the availability of sufficient financial, technical, and human
resources; the efficient and targeted use of resources, information, knowledge, and processes employed
by the organization (such as resource mobilization and income generation, human resources and staffing,
health programmes and process management, health service delivery, energy and water consumption,
waste management, technologies, infrastructure, and supply chain administration) (38,39).
6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 25
Lastly, institutional capacity needs to be strengthened, including enhancing the ability of health systems
to partner with other health-determining sectors to protect and promote health.
WHO projects a shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030, with 73% of this shortage concentrated in
the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions (40). High-income countries are increasingly depleting
the health workforce from an increasingly scarce pool of available health and care workers in LMICs (41).
This situation further weakens the capacity of the already vulnerable health systems to manage climate
related risks and be climate resilient (40).
Improved information, awareness and communication on health impacts of climate change, and
opportunities for reducing emissions, targeted to different audiences (e.g. policymakers, health facility
managers, media and communities) is critical and should be grounded in the principle of health equity.
This involves the ability to define and fulfil responsibilities in collaboration with other sectors, and
communicate with the public, including through the media. It is therefore important to build awareness
and media capacity to communicate climate risks and associated uncertainty effectively and responsibly,
and to identify how to best disseminate appropriate and constructive public service announcements.
Health actors can assist communities to be aware of the climate challenges they face, be involved
in risk identification, and participate in decision-making, thus becoming empowered to effectively
protect themselves. Community groups and leaders need to be prepared for responding to local risks,
knowing what role they play in preparedness, prevention, and response, and being aware of potentially
effective and equitable solutions and resources available to them. Communities often have valuable
local information about risks, community capacity and vulnerability that can help guide the formulation
of responses. Outreach, partnerships, stakeholder engagement, and effective two-way dialogue are vital
to improving how the health system and their health workforce function with the community. Workers in
other sectors need to be aware of the scope and scale of health risks that originate within their sectors;
and the need for effective dialogue to enable effective collaborative planning, policy, and implementation
of actions with co-benefits to health.
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Health workforce capacity – Sufficient number of health workers with the required technical capacity
to deal with the health risks posed by climate variability and change and to lead reductions in GHG
emissions.
Organizational capacity development – Resources, information, knowledge, and processes employed
by health organizations used in an efficient and targeted manner to promote climate resilience and
reduce their own GHG emissions and environmental impacts.
Information, awareness and communication – Improved information, awareness and communication on
health impacts from climate change and opportunities for reducing emissions targeted among different
target audiences (e.g. policymakers, health facility managers, media and communities).

6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 27
Assessments of climate and health risks
and GHG emissions
COMPONENT 3
Overview
This component includes a range of assessments that can be used to generate policy-relevant evidence
on the scale and nature of climate-related risks to health and health systems, and the impact of
health systems operations and GHGs emissions on the environment. It also includes generation of
information on health-promoting mitigation actions and policies in sectors responsible for most of the
GHG emissions.
There are several tools to support this framework component. Specifically, the climate change and health
vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessment is an essential tool for health policy and programmatic
planning (42). V&A assessments can help identify which populations and geographical areas are most
vulnerable to the different health impacts from climate hazards; establish baseline conditions and assess
potential health impacts from future climate change; support assessing changes in disease risks; define
the protective measures required; and the capacity of health systems to manage risks.
Successful V&A assessment processes will often include inputs from academic expert to ensure high
quality evidence, as well as managerial and operational personnel to ensure relevance to policy and
practice. The studies will examine health risks separately (e.g. heat stress, nutrition, dengue) and consider
how they interact with each other and with changes in other health determinants, such as ageing and
urbanization. Throughout the V&A assessment process a range of additional studies, analytical exercises
and tools may be used to gain a more holistic perspective of health vulnerability to climate change.
These include:
• vulnerability and risk mapping,
• modelling,
• scenario development,
• health system capacity and performance assessment,
• economic assessments,
• health impact assessments of decisions in other sectors,
• specific risk, events, and hazard assessments.
With regards to impacts from climate change, in addition to tools for assessing the health risks from
climate change at the population level, tools are also available to assess the vulnerability and impact of
climate change at health care facility level. Health facilities are often exposed to climate-related hazards
such as storms, drought, floods, sea-level rise, extreme heat, and increased outbreaks from climatesensitive diseases. Assessment of vulnerabilities and impacts, by hazard of concern can be done through
completion of checklists as proposed by the WHO and integrated into health programmes (10,11,43).
As health systems are responsible for approximately 5.2% of global carbon emissions (16), approaches
and tools to understand key hotspots of these emissions are needed. Understanding these emissions for 
28 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
the three GHG Protocol scopes (28) is essential to advance towards low carbon and net zero emissions.
New assessment tools for estimating GHG emissions from health systems and health care facilities are
being developed. Measurement of emissions by health systems and health care facilities will inform
the development of targeted decarbonization and environmental sustainability actions and plans. If
the resource is available, emissions measurement and monitoring should ideally be carried out by
teams embedded in each health system, with an expert knowledge of health system data and specific
national contexts. Developing a dedicated carbon analytics capability in health systems will help to
calculate emissions with more precision, fill evidence gaps, prioritize data-driven high impact projects,
and monitor and verify emissions reductions.
Understanding the potential health co-benefits of climate action and the cost of inaction, also provides
evidence for implementing effective and efficient actions, while increasing the capacity of health systems
to protect and promote health in a changing climate.

30 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Integrated risks monitoring, early
warning, and GHG emissions tracking
COMPONENT 4
Overview
This component aims to strengthen climate change and health integrated disease surveillance and
climate-informed early warning systems (EWS); integrated monitoring and progress tracking including
GHG emissions and other environmental impacts; and communication to inform timely action.
Climate change is altering the incidence and distribution of several climate-related health outcomes,
including the transmission of vector-, water-, and food-borne diseases, and NCDs, such as cardiovascular
diseases, respiratory illnesses, and mental health conditions. Building climate resilience to respond to
these challenges entails: (i) developing adequate capacity and flexibility to understand how climate
conditions influence health outcomes; (ii) being able to anticipate changing health risks; (iii) informing
preparedness, surveillance, and response in a timely manner; and (iv) monitoring health outcomes.
Developing integrated disease surveillance and climate-informed health early warnings will inform the
way vertical programmes deliver them.
The aim of integrated risk monitoring is to generate a holistic perspective of health risks with realtime information. It uses a set of diverse instruments to bring together information about health,
climatic and environmental conditions, and response capacity. It refers to the use of early detection
tools and epidemiological surveillance in conjunction with in-situ and remote sensing observations of
environmental determinants of health (e.g. water availability, air and water quality, variability in ambient
temperature, precipitation, humidity, or extreme weather events). Monitoring a broad range of signals
around a health risk can allow changing conditions to be identified more quickly in order to anticipate
detection of outbreaks and emergencies related to weather and climatic conditions (44).
Tracking qualitative and quantitative information about community and health system vulnerability,
preparedness and response capacity levels are also important elements of risk monitoring. For example,
it is important to maintain up-to-date information on whether high-risk regions have adequate workforce
and supplies during the cyclone season; whether certain areas have high concentrations of vulnerable
groups; as well as to identify regions and/or health facilities that could be more vulnerable to extreme
events due to setbacks caused by recent disasters, loss of leadership or resources.
Integrated risk monitoring is the basis for establishing EWS to identify, forecast and communicate highrisk conditions. In the context of infectious disease epidemics, the use of climate-informed EWS has the
potential to increase the effectiveness of disease control by intervening before or at the beginning of
the epidemic curve, instead of during the downward slope. Currently, the initiation of interventions is
heavily reliant on routine disease surveillance systems – data that often arrive too late for a preventative
response. However, forecasting of disease outbreaks using surveillance and weather information shows
promising potential. By combining these elements in a new EWS based on computational models, it
would be possible to improve both the timeliness and impact of disease control. The core elements of
climate-informed EWS are to: “(i) monitor environmental conditions; (ii) forecast high-risk conditions,
and initiate active surveillance; (iii) send alerts and communication; and (iv) establish a mechanism for
early response.” (44).
6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 31
In addition to building and implementing climate-informed health EWS, the health sector’s capacity
to understand and respond to the EWS for extreme weather events should be strengthened. Advanced
alert can provide additional lead-time to deploy appropriate preparedness measures and responses.
Short- and long-term risks related to climate change need to be monitored to ensure that shortterm interventions build flexibility and capacity to prepare for, respond to, and manage existing risks
and additional future risks, considering the different climate-sensitive health outcomes (23). Effective
risk monitoring and EWS can prevent illness, injury and death when coupled with adequate response
capacity (44).
Information sources on climate-risks may originate from local community knowledge, as well as multiple
fields of scientific and practice-based knowledge (such as epidemiology, meteorology and climate,
environment, agriculture, water resource management, environmental health surveillance). Relevant
information may be qualitative or quantitative, as well as observational or modelled.
Key environmental risks for the health system to monitor include extreme weather events, such as
temperatures known to induce heat or cold stress; air quality; UV radiation; rainfall and humidity levels
that favour or restrict vector abundance; El Niño/La Niña years; seasonal allergen loads and occurrences;
water availability and quality; and water and sanitation infrastructure preparedness for extreme events.
Because information on environmental and climate conditions are generally best collected and analysed
by their respective authorities, health authorities are not always expected (or have the capacity) to collect
these additional data. It is recommended to establish partnerships with the relevant data custodians,
such as meteorological agencies, hydrological and environmental services, academic institutions, or
others to access and appropriately interpret non-health information.
In addition to monitoring and predicting risks, health systems should also build their capacity to monitor
GHG emissions and track progress on emission reductions. This begins with measuring current emissions
using existing approaches. Data collected through the GHG emission assessment (refer to component 3)
will need to be integrated into the health monitoring system. Regular assessments of the GHG emissions,
health and environmental outcomes associated with sustainability measures should be continuously
improved to integrate new data and reflect the latest scientific evidence. Emissions progress should be
regularly monitored and reported publicly, for example through annual reports and the UNFCCC Global
Climate Action Portal. This will require collaboration across health sectors and among other sectors.
Environmental impacts from health systems are related to land use, air pollution and GHG emissions
through energy consumption (transport, electricity, heating, and cooling) as well as product manufacturing,
procurement, use and disposal. Sustainability, from this perspective, means implementing interventions
that optimize the consumption of resources (such as water, energy, food), and reduce GHG emissions
and waste discharge (including biological, chemical, radiological); and including procurement of goods
and services that follow the principles of environmental sustainability (10). Multidisciplinary teams,
public and private partnerships, and open access to consistent and comparable data will be essential
to interpret and monitor the emissions within and outside the health sector. There is a need to refine
current methods and tools that can be applied at the different levels of the health system (32,45).

34 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Health and climate research
COMPONENT 5
Overview
This component addresses the importance of providing evidence base towards policy relevant norms
and innovative solutions for climate change and health. It includes identifying strategic priorities for
fostering research agenda development and implementation; strengthening capacity for research; and
integrating research into policy.
Accurately estimating the impact that climate-sensitive health risks cause remains a challenge, despite
the unequivocal reality that climate change affects human health. Long-term effects depend on current
measures to reduce the emission of GHGs. Scientific research allows us to estimate increases in morbidity,
injuries and mortality caused by global warming.
Building climate resilience calls for both basic and applied research to reduce uncertainty about how
local conditions may be affected, gaining insight into local solutions and capacities, and building
evidence to strengthen decision-making. Implementing strategies for sustainable low carbon health
systems also need research support and development of assessment methods to support countries in
measuring the total health system resilience and carbon footprint.
Much research has been developed to understand and improve the evidence base on health systems
solutions across expanded networks for health, from action to improve health through safer and healthier
environments to new and emerging environmental risks, which include climate change. To develop,
evaluate, and update norms and regulations it is important to scale up evidence-based communication
to raise knowledge of health risks, impacts, costs to society, and how to identify, assess, monitor, and
respond to emerging environmental threats to health. This requires strategic policy relevant research
to drive innovative policy actions (46).
Research on climate change and health is advancing, but it is still limited in many areas such as on
methods to accurately estimate the burden of disease, the burden on the health system, effectiveness
of interventions to address the health impacts from climate change and build health system climate
resilience, methods for tracking the carbon footprint of health systems, and effectiveness of interventions
to decarbonize health services and associated supply chains. Key priorities for research going forward
include: promoting equity and social justice; strengthening the collection of sex-disaggregated data;
conducting economic assessments to quantify both the economic impacts of climate change and the
health costs of mitigation and adaptation actions; promoting collaborative intersectoral research;
bridging the knowledge and action gap; and improving advocacy and communication for motivating
and guiding choices and investments related to the reduction of GHGs and climate change and health
adaptation (47).
Research from global to local level can be used in the following ways: to gather knowledge on climate
risks to health and health systems’ impacts on the environment; the modulating effect of social and
environmental determinants of health; climate-sensitivity of diseases and risks; how communities and
health systems currently understand and cope with climate risks and GHG emission reductions; how 
6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 35
local conditions and vulnerabilities are connected to broader social and environmental determinants;
and the degree to which communities and local health services are prepared to reduce carbon emissions
and environmental impacts while responding to climate-related stress and shocks. Applied research
that can develop and test new low carbon technologies, data tools and instruments, and strategies for
risk management is also critical to evidence-based decision-making.
Research should inform existing knowledge management platforms, support relevant multidisciplinary
networks, be effectively communicated, and find opportunities to be translated into practice. Guidance
on priority knowledge gaps and ideas to shape national research can be found in global and regional
level research agendas, such as those led by the WHO (46,47). These may be made more relevant through
the adaptation to specific national or subnational context. Furthermore, a coordinated and prioritized
research agenda on climate change and health is necessary to support evidence-based programmatic,
policy and financial choices, and other recommendations for decision-making, and to identify health
co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation initiatives.

6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 37
Climate resilient and low carbon infrastructures, technologies, and supply chain
COMPONENT 6
Overview
This component addresses the need for, and importance of, strengthening adaptation of current
infrastructures, technologies, and supply chains; introducing new low carbon technologies; and promoting
environmental sustainability of health operations.
An important component for strengthening climate resilience of health systems relates to health
infrastructure and services, including the provision of essential preventive and curative health products,
from vaccines for climate sensitive diseases to surgical equipment. This includes ensuring that the
siting of health facilities and related building codes account for current and projected climate risks. It
also includes consideration of essential environmental services to health facilities, such as water and
sanitation and waste management services which may be compromised by extreme winds, flooding,
sea-level rise, or drought, and electricity supplies that may be cut off during extreme weather events. In
addition, infrastructures, technologies and supply chains need to ensure safety of the health workforce
in the face of climate change (10).
In addition to focusing on infrastructure, climate resilience can also be enhanced using new technologies
or approaches for better delivery of health interventions, particularly using information technology. For
example, mobile technologies combined with satellite-based remote sensing of meteorological and
environmental conditions on the ground have proven to be effective in improving access to reliable
extreme weather warnings, monitoring climate conditions, and surveillance and mapping of the
probability of transmission of climate-sensitive diseases (e.g. the detection of vector-borne or waterborne diseases and forecast of outbreaks).
Many operations are carbon intensive and therefore emit GHGs, contribute to air pollution and produce
environmental contaminants including chemical, biological, and radioactive waste.
While building climate resilience, health systems and health care facilities can also significantly reduce
their overall environmental impacts and GHG emissions through actions to develop sustainable
infrastructure, facilities and supply chains. This may include interventions to reduce GHG emissions
associated with energy and buildings, water, transport, food, and medicines, as well as the proper use
and disposal of health waste, and using safer chemicals in medical products and devices. It also includes
promoting opportunities for reducing consumption, reusing and/or recycling; eliminating non-essential
single use plastics; reducing food wastage, and developing sustainable procurement guidelines (10,48).
For example, mobile communication (e.g. tele-health or telemedicine) not only increases the speed and
volume of health data collection while reducing costs and improving service delivery, including during
emergencies, but also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the emissions associated
with transport and travel.
Selecting to use less energy-demanding technologies, medical and food supply chains with a lower
environmental carbon footprint and decentralized renewable energy sources, such as solar-powered
photovoltaics, can simultaneously contribute to climate resilience and long-term environmental 
38 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
sustainability. It is also important to support technologies that are climate resilient and suitable for
the harsh conditions that are likely to be more common in a climate change context, such as higher
temperatures.
Health care supply chains account for an estimated 60–80% of a health care system’s carbon footprint
(29,49). It is therefore important that health care systems and their suppliers take action to reduce
supply chain emissions. Health systems can leverage their purchasing power by persuading suppliers
to decarbonize their own processes and onward supply chains, for example by reducing the carbon
footprint of products through the use of cleaner energy, better design for reuse, repair and recovery
of materials, and the choice of purchasing locally manufactured products (50). The NHS in England, for
example, has published a net zero supplier road map setting out requirements for suppliers to align
with the NHS’s net zero targets (51). Given the global reach and complexity of supply chains, health
systems are encouraged to work with international partners – for example through the WHO’s ATACH
group – to support health care supply chain decarbonization, including through the potential alignment
of procurement standards across health systems internationally.
For the supply chain, it will not only be important to ensure access to key medical products, but also
to understand how changing climatic conditions could influence the effectiveness of specific medical
products. For example, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics and diuretics may predispose
their users to heat stroke or heat stress when temperatures are high.
Sample interventions aiming to strengthen climate resilience and environmental sustainability in
health facilities across four key components (i.e. health workforce; water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste
management; energy; and infrastructure, technologies and products) is available in the WHO guidance
for climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health care facilities (10).

Management of environmental
determinants of health
COMPONENT 7
Overview
This component aims to step up efforts to respond to environmental risks to health by strengthening
monitoring and management of environmental determinants of health; developing and implementing
regulatory instruments and mechanisms; and promoting coordinated intersectoral management.
Climate change threatens health through environmental determinants, strongly mediated by social
conditions. For this reason, some of the most effective actions that can be taken by health systems are
in collaboration with other sectors. Scaling up multisectoral public health prevention programmes can
avoid negative health outcomes at their source and facilitate timely and increasingly effective responses
to changing environmental and climate-related risk conditions. A timely health sector response to
potential hazards from health service activities by itself or in coordination with other sectors is imperative
(Table 6.1). Similarly, health-promoting policies and programmes in sectors, such as agriculture, transport,
water, housing, and energy can lead to reduced health risks and improved environmentally sustainable
health practices, behaviours, and processes.
Environmental risks are responsible for around a quarter of the total burden of disease (52).
Notwithstanding substantive efforts to reduce environmental risks to health, traditional risks to public
health (such as unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, poor hygiene, and lack of access to safe and
reliable energy) affect poor and vulnerable populations disproportionally, challenging efforts towards
health equity. Despite important and ongoing efforts to protect health from these traditional risks,
climate change is a huge challenge requiring scaling up of efforts in all countries. Climate change impacts
on NCDs are also large, and in some cases less recognized, such as the impacts on mental health (46,53).
While the health sector does not have substantial direct control over environmental determinants,
it has essential roles to play at both policy and programmatic levels in: (i) providing evidence on risk
factor disease links; (ii) implementing effective preventive measures; (iii) raising awareness; (iv) jointly
monitoring environmental exposures and health outcomes; and (v) defining regulatory standards and
management of health risks. Management of environmental determinants of health requires intersectoral
planning and coordination. Examples of joint actions aiming to manage the environmental determinants
of health are included in Table 6.1.

Climate-informed health programmes
COMPONENT 8
Overview
This component aims to use the information gathered in the components related to health information
systems (i.e. assessments, research and monitoring) to inform the way specific climate sensitive health
programmes deliver them.
The health sector, in coordination with other sectors, is often directly responsible for programmes
that address climate-sensitive health risks (such as vector- and water- borne diseases, mental health,
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, maternal and newborn health, nutrition), preparedness and
response to extreme weather and environmental events, as well as other crises. Emerging climate and
environmental risks to health requires an update of existing health programmes and their management
to strengthen their response capacity with adequate, effective, and sustainable interventions. Examples of
climate-sensitive health programmes which should work in collaboration with climate change and health
focal points or units in the ministries of health are emergencies and disaster risk management, public
health preparedness, early warnings, food security and nutrition, occupational health, infectious disease
monitoring, climate-sensitive disease surveillance, and several vertical programmes for communicable
and NCDs and injury prevention. Such programmes can become climate resilient by using information
about current and projected future climate conditions to assess risks against operating capacity gaps
and inform policy, strategic investment, and planning decisions.
Health planning, programming and operations should consider environmental and climate risks
to promote climate resilience in health systems and UHC. Climate services are specifically tailored
information, tools, and products which can be developed in partnership with meteorological and climate
services to enable health partners to access and use information about weather, climate, climate change,
climate variability, trends, and impacts to improve decision-making in specific programme areas (54).
Simultaneously health programmes should assess their environmental sustainability, ensuring that no
adverse health and environment consequences result from their operations. This implies that health
programming and operations should increasingly be designed and implemented considering both current
and projected future climate change hazards. Assessments should consider how health programmes are
impacted by climate change now and in the future; how to better prepare and respond; to what extent
the health programme contributes to GHG emissions directly or indirectly; and how their operations
may also release environmental contaminants.
Specific health programmes can use information gathered through the implementation of components
3 (assessment of climate and health risks and GHG emissions) and 4 (integrated risks monitoring, early
warning, and GHG emissions tracking) to improve their decision-making capabilities and adjust the type
and scale of intervention accordingly. For example, early warnings about a potential outbreak or extreme
heat conditions can be used to prepare the health system in advance for increased patient loads and
any other related needs. Climate-informed health programming needs to continually review and adjust
service delivery according to new information. Table 6.2 provides examples of interventions on climaterelated health risks that can improve health system capacity to improve climate change resilience and
reduce carbon emissions.

Climate-related emergency preparedness
and management
COMPONENT 9
Overview
This component aims to build preparedness, response capacity and health security in health systems
and communities by: implementing climate related risks management for emergencies and disasters,
through climate-smart policies and protocols; establishing climate-informed health emergency and
disaster risk management; and supporting community empowerment.
Outbreaks and health emergencies triggered by extreme weather events are primary concerns of climate
change. Climate-informed preparedness plans, emergency response systems, and community-based
disaster and emergency management are essential for building climate resilience in health systems
and communities, which are vulnerable to a wide range of hazardous events. Thus, health systems and
communities should aim to holistically manage overall public health risks and emphasize preparedness
and prevention in addition to the usual focus on response capacity.
As climate change increases in magnitude, climate-related emergencies and disasters will continue to
rise causing cascading damages and losses in ecological and human systems resulting in unprecedented
losses. National emergency operation plans that apply an all-hazards strategy, comprehensive emergency
management principles and whole-of-society approaches are necessary.
The Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (H-EDRM) framework is a rights-based approach
to developing national strategies for emergencies and disasters. Addressing climate risks in H-EDRM
requires whole-of-society actions (60).
To strengthen their readiness, health system operations including health facilities and public health
infrastructure should implement integrated approaches to H-EDRM (60) as part of developing an
all-hazards H-EDRM framework that includes climate hazards. Climate-based H-EDRM must use a
comprehensive emergency management (CEM) approach. The CEM approach refers to a series of closely
interrelated prevention/mitigation, emergency preparedness (including operational readiness), response,
and recovery measures. It is based on the premise that prevention and mitigation measures can reduce
the likelihood and severity of emergencies; that sound preparedness will lead to a more timely and
effective response; that coordinated response will result in appropriate targeting of health services to
the needs of those affected with a focus on the most vulnerable; and that recovery and reconstruction
should be designed to reduce future risks.
The implementation of EDRM in health systems – considering climate change risks and low-carbon
operations – contributes to building climate resilience and to protecting population health.
Furthermore, tools are available to support countries to assess hospital safety and vulnerabilities and
make recommendations on necessary actions while promoting low-cost/high-impact measures for
improving safety and strengthening emergency preparedness. These include the Hospital Safety Index
(HSI) (48), the Smart Hospitals Toolkit (43), the Green Checklist and discussion guide (61), and Baseline
Assessment Tool, developed for the Caribbean context (62). The latter tools are useful for guiding
hospitals to identify and implement adaptation measures and inform retrofitting. 
6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 49
Community-based actions are at the forefront of protecting health in emergencies and disasters, including
those related to extreme weather events. Policies, programmes, and strategies related to reducing
health risks from climate change and related emergencies and disasters require multisectoral action
with community participation (such as health workforce, various community groups, women groups,
private sectors, key health-determining sectors, and private sector) in health decision making (60).
Therefore, a stakeholder mechanism to support participation, dialogue and information exchange among
community groups, including underrepresented population segments, would help implement effective
actions towards emergency and disaster prevention, preparedness, and response from different types
of climate events to reduce health risks and outcomes. Ensuring equity – particularly for vulnerable
populations and regions at risk, including rights-based gender-sensitive issues, and environmental
sustainability measures – is an important consideration in climate-smart policies and protocols for
emergency and disaster risk management strategies (60).
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Policies and protocols – Climate sensitive health risks and low-carbon operations included within
national disaster reduction strategies, plans and protocols and wider development processes.
Risk management – Strengthen health system capacity to manage risks so that overall vulnerability
and exposure to climate hazards are reduced and residual risks and uncertainties effectively managed.
Community empowerment – Empower communities to effectively prevent and respond to health risks
from extreme weather events.

6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 51
Sustainable climate and health financing
COMPONENT 10
Overview
The objective of this component is to support countries in identifying and accessing sustainable financing
to support climate change and health interventions and proposes ensuring access to: health specific
funding and financing mechanisms, including climate change funding streams; and funding allocated
for health-determining sectors.
Effectively protecting health from climate change will incur financial costs for health systems. The direct
damage costs from climate change to health (excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as
agriculture and water and sanitation), is estimated to be US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030 (63).
Given the dynamics of climate change risks and their likely effects on societal and human systems,
governments will be required to have the ability to act timely and appropriately by using strategies
that enable access to, release, and use of financial resources. For example, health systems may need to
allocate resources to expand their geographical or seasonal range or population coverage of surveillance
and control programmes for climate-sensitive infectious diseases, recruit and retain health workers, or
retrofit health facilities to withstand more extreme weather events.
Investing in health will also create benefits from the reduction of economic impacts, such as reduction of
direct and indirect costs from climate-related diseases and its impacts on health systems. Implementing
measures that can increase climate resilience and sustainable low carbon in health systems can generate
a high cost–benefit return, especially in the long term, reflecting in both environmental and social
goods, and improving the health and well-being of populations (32). Additional investments may also
be needed in other sectors to achieve health goals, such as implementing the promotion of healthy and
sustainable diets, using cleaner energy sources and climate resilient water safety plans, or enhanced
food security forecasting and nutritional screening during droughts.
Unfortunately, most countries vulnerable to climate change impacts have no financial capacity to address
the needed adaptation and mitigation actions (64).
In order to mobilize and utilize financial resources to adequately respond to climate threats, assessments
of resource requirements, available finance, as well as finance gaps and opportunities to fill them, are
needed. Resource requirements can be assessed through budget estimations of selected interventions
as identified in the V&A assessment or HNAP, and identifying shortfalls in existing budgets and funding
sources that need to be addressed through mobilization of new financial resources. For example, if
an increase in extreme weather events is predicted, then resources will need to be mobilized for
contingencies or to cover the costs of insurance or replacement costs for damaged health facilities,
protecting and safeguarding health workers, and lost or damaged uninsured equipment. Planning and
risk management teams should consider that in addition to adequate development funds to maintain
the function of core health care and public health services, climate change specific funding mechanisms
should be accessed so as to effectively build system resilience.
52 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
A comprehensive approach to financing health protection from climate change should first build on
core investments in health systems, such as investments to ensure adequate numbers of competent
health workforce and basic health infrastructure and services, which also help to address climate change
risks. This can be supported from national resources or external donors (e.g. the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)).
In addition to accessing health finance, funding can also be mobilized by integrating climate change
and health considerations in investments in key health-determining sectors. For example, national
governments and donors make very large investments in water and sanitation, which improve health
and generally reduce climate vulnerability to impacts. Adding criteria for climate resilience and health
promotion to investment strategies can ensure that these investments bring the greatest possible
benefits in terms of human health, climate adaptation and social return on investment over the long
term. Investing in implementing health and climate change interventions in health-determining sectors,
such as water, energy, transport, and food and agriculture will protect health and advance climate justice.
Interventions should consist of cost-effective approaches, and also consider the cost of inaction, for
ensuring that selected approaches result in socioeconomic welfare.
Lastly, opportunities are available to mobilize climate change finance for health. The key international
climate change funding streams are included in Box 6.1.
Box 6.1 Main global climate change funding mechanisms
Green Climate Fund (GCF): At the 16th session of the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP) in 2010, the Parties
established the GCF to assist in mobilizing funding for low-emission and climate-resilient development.
The GCF was designated as an operating entity of the financial mechanism accountable to the COP in 2011,
and remains involved in decision-making regarding policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria
for funding. The WHO has been approved as a GCF Readiness Delivery Partner, enabling WHO to support
countries in accessing GCF Readiness funds, undertaking adaptation planning and developing strategic
frameworks to build their programming with the GCF.
Global Environment Facility (GEF): was established in 1992, is an international partnership with a large
network of countries, international institutions, private sector, and civil society organizations. It serves as
an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC to provide financial resources to developing
country Parties.
Parties also founded the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and the Least Developed Countries Fund
(LDCF), which are both managed by the GEF. The SCCF was established to finance initiatives relating to
adaptation; technology transfer and capacity building; energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and
waste management; and economic diversification. The LDCF was established to support least developed
countries in preparing and implementing National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs).
Adaptation Fund (AF): was established under the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, also supports environmental
initiatives by financing concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are
particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. The AF is managed by the Adaptation
Fund Board.
Source: Finance for health and climate change (64).
Further guidance on the entry points for health under each of these funding streams is provided by the
WHO (64). In addition to the main international climate change specific financing mechanisms, funding
is also available through bilateral and regional channels. 
6. Framework components for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems 53
The ATACH Finance Working Group aims to support countries aiming to access finance and funding for
climate change and health by reducing barriers to funding and by maximizing investments in health (3).

7 Alignment with climate change, development, and specific health priorities 55
7 Alignment with climate change, development, and
specific health priorities
7.1. Alignment with climate change and development priorities
Building climate resilient and low carbon sustainable health systems, is the comprehensive health
response to requests by Parties to the UNFCCC for provision of support in planning adaptation and
mitigation to climate change in key sectors. Additionally, this framework responds to and is aligned
with global agendas including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework
for Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai Framework), and the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. This framework can
be used as a key tool to support countries integrating health within relevant national climate change
planning and reporting mechanisms and processes such as to develop the health component of HNAPs,
health in the NDCs, and health in the LT-LEDS (Box 7.1).
Box 7.1 Health in the main country commitments to the UNFCCC
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
NDCs are country commitments to deliver the goal of the Paris Agreement (adopted in 2015) of limiting
global temperature rise to below 2o
C, preferably to 1.5o
C. Countries can strengthen their NDCs to the
Paris Agreement by developing health-inclusive and health-promoting climate targets and policies. The
inclusion of public health considerations in the NDCs provides an opportunity for increased ambition
and outlines countries’ current priorities and needs, ensuring healthy people and societies in a changing
climate. Some recommendations on health promoting NDCs with public health measures that can benefit
national mitigation and adaptation, and implementation priorities are proposed by the WHO (31,65).
Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP)
The HNAP is a plan developed by a country’s Ministry of Health as part of the National Adaptation Plan
(NAP) process, which is an ongoing initiative of the UNFCCC to support countries to address the challenges
of climate change risks. The process to formulate and implement NAPs is intended to provide support for
the medium- and long-term adaptation planning needs in least developed countries (LDCs) and other
developing countries to build resilience to climate change across all relevant sectors, including the health
sector. HNAPs outline actions to build climate resilience for health, and in health system strengthening
their ability to anticipate, absorb and transform in a changing climate, in order to protect population health
while improving the management of other health threats. HNAP is an important process for mobilizing
domestic financial resources for climate actions in health systems, maximizing synergies across sectors,
and promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and cooperation for health (9,66).
Long-term low-emissions development strategies (LT-LEDS)
Parties to the Paris Agreement have underscored their commitment to achieving the long-term temperature
target of the Paris Agreement by implementing LT-LEDS. A recent UNFCCC report assessed submitted
LT-LEDS and identified country needs for large-scale transformation as a challenge to transition to lowemission development paths, especially in terms of financing. Many Parties highlighted opportunities to
achieve a sustainable, equitable, and inclusive economic development. Human health was identified as
an adaptation priority in 45% of reviewed LT-LEDS. Adaptation measures included developing a climateresilient public health system and infrastructure, early warning systems for diseases and extreme weather
events, research and innovation, training health-care professionals, and mainstreaming adaptation into
health policies (67). The WHO conducted a similar assessment of health inclusion in LT-LEDs. Of the
53 available reports, 98% include health considerations, 75% identifies health co-benefits of climate
mitigation, and 32% quantified these health co-benefits (65).
56 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
7.2. Alignment with health priorities
This framework responds to policy mandates to protect health, at global, regional, and national levels,
including the World Health Assembly (WHA) and WHO regional committee resolutions on health
protection from climate change, health system strengthening, implementation of International Health
Regulations, UHC and health security strengthening, as well as national health emergency and disaster
risk management (H-EDRM).
The framework is aligned with health system priorities and goals for health – which are: (i) the goals are
UHC, better health, and health security; (ii) means to achieve the goals in health system strengthening;
(iii) primary health care (PHC), that includes the essential public health functions (EPHF) – with the
approach to strengthen health systems which ensures that values of health for all, solidarity, equity,
social justice, community orientation, people-centredness and human rights are fulfilled (Box 7.2).
Box 7.2 The framework and health systems priorities and goals
What is needed and how can the framework contribute to UHC and PHC priorities and goals?
• A radical reorientation of health systems towards PHC, to address the carbon footprint of health
systems and strengthen climate resilience. Secondary and tertiary care are often more costly and create
more carbon emissions because of factors such as one-time use medical products and devices, heavy
infrastructure, medical waste, and the need to travel farther from where people live.
• Public health orientation underpinned by the EPHFs, to address climate related health risks and
impacts. Many public health services, including health promotion, prevention and protection services,
while cost-saving are also able to respond to the impacts of climate change and various other public
health challenges.
• People-centredness, where health systems are oriented towards and aligned with population health
needs, responding to community health needs, and avoiding wastage of resources.
• Community engagement, because community ownership supports the sustainable change of health
systems in the long term.
• All-hazard health emergency and disaster management approach, ensuring climate-resilience can
be utilized as an entry point for all-hazards resilience of health systems; and thus, capacities and
investments can be leveraged for multiple types of threats.
• Health equity, because climate-related risks often affect disadvantaged populations and communities
disproportionately.
• Multisectoralism, because a climate-resilient and low carbon health system needs health sector
leadership and coordination with allied sectors.

8 Monitoring progress at national level towards climate resilience and low carbon sustainability in health systems 57
8 Monitoring progress at national level towards climate
resilience and low carbon sustainability in health systems
Measuring the climate resilience and decarbonization actions of a health system is most effectively done
with information and indicators that are tailored to needs, priorities, and available resources, and build
on existing national surveillance and monitoring systems. Relevant international reporting mechanisms
include data available in the WHO’s Global Health Observatory, the WHO health and climate change
global survey, and the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (23).
In order to measure climate resilience and low carbon sustainability in health systems, a comprehensive
approach is suggested by which at least one indicator for each the 10 components are selected (both
for resilience and low carbon pathways). Countries and health systems may refer to the list of indicative
measurable outputs and indicators included in each of the components above, which are also compiled
in Annex A, and decide whether those are relevant to their specific context or whether these should be
adapted, or new ones developed.
In addition to measuring climate resilience and low carbon sustainability in health systems using
specific indicators for each of the 10 components of this operational framework, the WHO paper on
Measuring the climate resilience of health systems (23) recommends using additional indicators that track
changes in: (i) the upstream determinants of exposures and vulnerabilities; (ii) the overall capacity of
a health system to manage climate-related shocks and stresses; and (iii) the extent to which resilience
outcomes change following adaptation interventions. Short- and long-term climate-related risks need
to be monitored to ensure that near-term interventions build flexibility and capacity to prepare for and
manage additional climate change impacts over the coming decades. 

9 Conclusions 59
9 Conclusions
This framework provides the tools and validation for health systems to take action to build climate
resilience and reduce carbon emissions. They also lead by example to protect people’s health and the
environment, with immediate and long-term health benefits for all.
By implementing the framework components, health organizations, programmes and partners would
be better able to anticipate, prevent, prepare for, and manage climate-related health risks while
implementing environmental sustainability, including low carbon health practices, leading to improved
health outcomes. Application of this framework would result in an important contribution to UHC, global
health security, and specific targets within the SDGs.

Annex B. Glossary 81
Annex B. Glossary
Adaptation
Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems,
adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human
intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (1).
Climate resilient health systems
Climate resilient health systems are those capable of anticipating, responding to, coping with, recovering
from, and adapting to climate-related shocks and stress, to bring about sustained improvements in
population health, despite an unstable climate (2).
Climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Climate resilient and low carbon health systems are those capable of anticipating, responding to, coping
with, recovering from, and adapting to climate-related shocks and stress, while minimizing GHG emissions
and other negative environmental impacts to deliver quality care and protect the health and well-being
of present and future generations (as defined in this document).
Co-benefits
Co-benefits are the positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective could have on other
objectives, thereby increasing the total benefits for society or the environment (1).
Decarbonization
Decarbonization is the process by which countries, individuals or other entities aim to achieve zero
fossil carbon existence. Typically refers to a reduction in carbon emissions associated with electricity,
industry and transport (1).
Essential public health functions (EPHF)
EPHFs are usually seen as a list of minimum requirements for countries to ensure public health (3).
Exposure
Exposure is the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services,
and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could
be adversely affected (1).
Hazard
Hazard is the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that
may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property,
infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems, and environmental resources (1).
Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP)
HNAP is a plan led by the Ministry of Health, as part of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process.
HNAP refers to the plan/document itself (4).
82 Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems
Health services
Health services refer to activities – any service (i.e. not limited to medical or clinical services) aimed
at contributing to improved health or to the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of sick people (3).
Health systems
The health system comprises all the organizations, institutions, people, resources, and actions whose
primary purpose is to improve, restore or maintain health. The goals of a health system are improving
health and health equity in ways that are responsive, financially fair and make the best or most efficient
use of available resources. Six health system building blocks together constitute a complete health
system – health service delivery; health workforce; health information; medical technologies; health
financing; leadership and governance (3).
Impacts (consequences, outcomes)
Impacts (consequences, outcomes) are the consequences of realized risks on natural and human
systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather
and climate events), exposure, and vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods,
health and well-being, ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services (including
ecosystem services), and infrastructure. Impacts may be referred to as consequences or outcomes, and
can be adverse or beneficial (1).
Low carbon health systems
Low carbon health systems are those capable of implementing transformative strategies towards
reducing GHG emissions in their operations, reducing short- and long-term negative impacts on the
local and global environment.
Mitigation (of climate change)
Mitigation (of climate change) refers to a human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance
the sinks of greenhouse gases (1).
National Adaptation Plan (NAP)
The NAP is a process established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework enabling Parties to formulate
and implement the NAP as a means of identifying medium- and long-term adaptation needs and
developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those needs. It is a continuous,
progressive and iterative process that follows a country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory and fully
transparent approach (5).
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
The term NDCs is used under the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) whereby a country that has joined the Paris Agreement outlines its plans for reducing its
emissions. NDCs of some countries also address how they will adapt to climate change impacts, and
what support they need from, or will provide to, other countries to adopt low carbon pathways and to
build climate resilience (1).
Net-zero emissions
Net-zero emissions are achieved when GHGs emitted into the atmosphere are balanced by anthropogenic
removals. Where multiple GHGs are involved, the quantification of net-zero emissions depends on the
climate metric chosen to compare emissions of different gases (such as global warming potential, global
temperature change potential, and others, as well as the chosen time horizon) (1).
Annex B. Glossary 83
Public health
Public health refers to all organized efforts (whether public or private) to prevent disease, promote
health and prolong life among the population as a whole. Public health focuses on the entire spectrum
of health and well-being from health promotion and prevention of disease, to early identification and
management, to rehabilitation and end-of-life care, or promotion, protection and prevention. Public
health usually includes three broad domains of practice: health protection, health service improvement
and health improvement, with these being underpinned by health intelligence (3).
Public health services
Public health services refer to health services that promote and protect the health of a defined population.
These include, among others, health situation analysis, health surveillance, health promotion, prevention
services, infectious disease control, environmental protection and sanitation, disaster preparedness and
response and occupational health. Public health services also include the provision of personal services
to individuals, such as vaccinations, behavioural counselling or health advice (3).
Resilience
Resilience is the capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous
event, trend, or disturbance, by responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function,
identity, and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation (1).
Risk
Risk is the potential for adverse consequences where something of value is at stake and where the
occurrence and degree of an outcome is uncertain. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability (of
the affected system), its exposure over time (to the hazard), as well as the (climate-related) hazard and
the likelihood of its occurrence (1).
Universal health coverage (UHC)
UHC means that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when
and where they need them, without financial hardship. It covers the full continuum of essential health
services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care across the
life course (6).
Vulnerability 
Vulnerability is the condition determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or
processes, which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or systems to the
impacts of hazards (7).
