Environmental pollution and other environmental risks cause almost a quarter of the worldwide disease
burden. To eliminate or at least substantially reduce this disease burden and to address the challenges in
health, environment and climate change being faced, bold preventive action at national, regional, local and
sector-specific level is needed. Policy-makers and other actors are increasingly prepared to take action
on health and the environment, often as a result of requests by citizens and organizations, and need to be
supported by adequate resources.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and various other United Nations (UN) organizations offer guidance
on effective actions on health and the environment distributed over hundreds of different reports. This
compendium consists of a systematic compilation of WHO and other UN guidance that addresses all major
areas of health and the environment into one resource. Unlike regular reports, this compendium presents a
database or repository extracting the relevant guidance for policy-makers and other key target audiences on
health and the environment and refers to the original reports if more detail is needed.
This compendium supports the strategic objectives and their implementation at country-level of the WHO
Global Strategy on Health, Environment and Climate Change to scale up action on health determinants in
all policies and in all sectors for health protection and improvement. It further supports the implementation
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to address environmental risks through a shift towards
primary preventive actions and the promotion of healthy choices.
In publishing this compendium, WHO seeks to assist policy-makers and other actors in countries to take
actions to improve the health of people and the environment and reduce health inequities and provide
assistance with implementation of norms and solutions. It does this by summarizing in one resource the
most crucial policy recommendations to improve health and reduce the disease burden coming from
environmental risks; it further provides guidance on the ways in which policy-makers and other actors can
raise awareness of the risks being faced and the healthy practices people can take to reduce them.

Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment
viii
The World Health Organization (WHO) and other United Nations (UN) organizations have published extensive
guidance on a range of essential health topics over the years, specifically addressing disease, environmental
pollutants, children’s health, among many other topics. To date, however, there has been no systematic
compilation of this guidance for policy-makers and decision-makers, which makes it difficult to get an overview
of options available, and to determine where linkages exist between sectors and levels of government.
This compendium seeks to address these gaps by providing a systematic compilation of published guidance
from WHO and other UN organizations on all major areas of health and the environment. This guidance also
includes information about ways to raise awareness and advocate among the public and policy-makers,
in addition to information about interventions to build and enhance capacity among various stakeholders.
Guidance referring to priority settings for action – such as cities and other urban settlements, housing,
workplaces and health care facilities – is also listed, as is guidance on cross-cutting topics, such as
children’s environmental health and Health in All Policies, which aims to enhance collaboration across
sectors to systematically consider health in policy-making.
For greater practical relevance, each section of guidance is classified according to principally involved
sectors, level of implementation and instruments for implementation.
The compilation of guidance for each area of health and the environment or priority setting for action is
accompanied, as available, by information on main sources, exposure assessment and existing guideline
values. Important tools and further resources are presented alongside, such as tools for assessment or
implementing interventions.
This compilation of published guidance on health and the environment highlights that a large number of
actions across major topics of health and the environment are available to improve health and reduce
environmental risks. Compilation into one volume also shows how this guidance often involves various
sectors and is applicable to various levels – local, regional and national. Where such interlinkages exist, this
has been indicated in the text.
This compendium is intended to serve as a repository and easy-to-use resource for decision-makers and
policy-makers working in the health and environmental sectors at various levels. It will be updated as
additional guidance becomes available.
Executive summary
1
As much as 24% of deaths are estimated to be attributable to environmental risks to health which are largely
preventable (1). Acting on environmental conditions can be a key contribution to reduce many communicable
and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries. To cite a few statistics, as much as 29% of deaths from
ischaemic heart disease, 28% of stroke, 21% of cancers, 55% of respiratory infections, 61% of diarrhoeal
diseases, 53% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 40% of road traffic injuries and 76% of
unintentional poisonings could be prevented through environmental improvements globally (1). Preventive
action through creating healthier environments should therefore be an important component of most disease
control strategies.
Clean air, both indoors and outdoors, stable climate, adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), safe
use of chemicals, protection from radiation, sound waste management, healthy and safe workplaces, healthsupportive cities and built environments, sustainable diets, and preserved biodiversity and ecosystems
are essential for ensuring good health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has served as
another reminder of the intrinsic linkage between human health and nature.
This compendium presents key guidance to those wishing to create healthier environments to address these
statistics, minimize preventable deaths and disability and improve health now and in the future. It summarizes
and aims to facilitate access to guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other United Nations
(UN) agencies, funds and programmes for creating healthier environments for healthier populations.
 Environment in this compendium refers to the following environmental factors (2):
• air, water and soil pollution with chemical and biological agents including air pollution from
second-hand tobacco smoke;
• ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation;
• electromagnetic fields (EMFs);
• occupational risks;
• the built environment, including housing, workplaces, the provision of water for washing
hands, land-use patterns and roads;
• climate and ecosystem change;
• behaviour related to environmental factors, for example, hand-washing hygiene and physical
activity fostered through improved urban design.
For this compendium, the following factors are not considered environmental:
• alcohol and tobacco consumption;
• diet (unless linked to climate change, environmental degradation or contamination through
chemical and biological agents);
• unemployment;
• person-to-person disease transmission that cannot reasonably be prevented through
environmental interventions.

1.1 Target audience
This compendium aims to provide practitioners with a rapid overview of WHO and other UN-recommended
actions and tools to address various health risks. Practitioners targeted in particular include key decisionmakers at national, regional and municipal levels, government officials, higher-level policy-makers, key actors
such as municipal staff, staff in relevant ministries (including those working with industry), community health
workers, WHO and UN partner agencies’, funds’ and programmes’ country representatives and country staff,
and nongovernmental organizations planning or performing country work.
1.2 Methods used for the development of
the compendium
This compendium was developed by systematically compiling existing published guidance on health and
the environment from WHO and other UN organizations. Relevant WHO technical units were systematically
consulted on structure, content and resources. The units’ inputs and subsequent reviews were incorporated.
Relevant other UN organizations, responsible for content directly related to health and the environment, were
also consulted for their inputs and review.
Guidance was included when referring to health protection and promotion by modifying the environment,
safeguarding natural environments and climate, reducing pollution, introducing personal protective measures
and promoting healthy behaviours linked to environmental exposures. Approaches included cover: i) primary
prevention to act on determinants of health, ii) cross-sectoral action to ensure Health in All Policies (HiAP)
effectively reach all environmental determinants of health, iii) strengthening of the health sector to build
mechanisms for governance and political and social support, and iv) effective communication on risks and
solutions to guide choices and investments, as put forward in the WHO global strategy on health, environment
and climate change (3).
Collated guidance was grouped under the categories “policies and actions” and “awareness raising and
capacity building”. Guidance was further attributed classifiers in order to provide useful information on the
type of strategy or intervention to the implementer and the planner, as well as to serve as a search tool. These
classifiers were informed by existing UN intervention guidance, including Disease control priorities, improving
health and reducing poverty from the World Bank, Healthy environments for healthy children: key messages
for action from WHO and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Programme guidance for
early life prevention of non-communicable diseases from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (4-6).
Classifiers for each type of guidance include: i) the sectors principally involved in planning/implementation;
ii) the level of implementation; and iii) the type of instrument (see section 1.3 How to use this compendium).
Another version of this compendium also contains classification of all interventions according to the
International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) in view of reporting and analysing health interventions
for statistical purposes (7).
1 The codes were developed according to the ICHI classification system, and
also use the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD; 11th revision) (8) and
International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) (9) where relevant, which
provide additional specificity to define interventions.
The list of guidance is not comprehensive and will be updated as additional information becomes available.
1 An additional version of the Compendium with ICHI codes will be made available as a separate document.

1. Background
1.3 How to use this compendium
There are many opportunities where interventions can be leveraged to create healthier environments. This
compendium provides an overview of guidance by environmental area, and points to more detailed WHO
and other UN guidance for the next implementation steps. It serves to outline actions to create healthier
environments and to guide and support the user in view of engaging in strategic discussions with other sectors
and partners where necessary, to effect these changes.
While the main part of each section covers guidance, each section also provides information on assessment
of the current situation (local data, exposure modelling, databases) and pollution sources; targets to achieve
(guideline values) and selected tools are also provided where relevant.
Not all the guidance in this compendium will apply and work equally well in every context. Therefore the
local circumstances and priorities should be considered before implementing any interventions, strategies
or actions. Local circumstances may include: i) distribution of exposures to the risk factor; ii) effectiveness
of source or exposure reduction by the strategy or solution; iii) health impact of the measure; and iv) cost–
effectiveness of the measure.
Guidance in this compendium can be searched by the following classifiers.
• Sector principally involved in planning/implementation:2 health, environment, agriculture, transport,
industry, food, water/sanitation, waste, energy, housing, construction, land use planning, education,
labour, finance, social welfare and family, sports and leisure, civil defence or multiple sectors.
• Level of implementation: national level, community, schools/child-care settings, health care, workplace.
The additional classifier “universal health coverage” was attributed to guidance where the health sector
directly contributes to achieving universal health coverage (often through prevention efforts by health
workers in the community).
• Instruments: governance; regulation; taxes and subsidies; infrastructure, technology and built
environment; other management and control; assessment and surveillance; information, education and
communication; or other action.
Although not systematically mentioned throughout each section of this compendium, most areas will require
adequate monitoring and evaluation, capacity building and resource mobilization, which will therefore not be
repeated in every section. In addition, all policies and plans should consider gender and equity components
when being established or implemented.
Messages for promoting health in the general population have been developed based on the guidance
contained in this compendium and can be used by the audience to more broadly promote health (see Annex).
This compendium will be available in both print and online versions. References in the former will be located at
the end of the document, while references in the latter will be included after each relevant chapter.
2 This will usually focus on the main sector(s) responsible for planning/implementation. Early engagement of diverse
sectors however needs to take place in most guidance to ensure active participation in the process, which will
support implementation in the short–medium and long-term.

a Coloured dots represent attributable fractions; an attributable fraction is the proportional reduction in death or disease that would occur if exposure
to a risk were removed or reduced to a minimum exposure distribution currently achieved in certain population groups. The ranges of the attributable
fractions are:

comparative risk assessment or expert opinion. They are discussed in further detail in (2). b Limited to industrial and agricultural chemicals and chemicals involved in acute poisonings. c Global climate change will increasingly influence our lives. This table covers current risks to health. While hollow circles have been added to this table

1.5 Links with social determinants of health
Many diseases and adverse health conditions such as malnutrition are strongly related to social determinants
of health, which are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of
forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. Some social determinants of health are closely linked
with environmental factors such as housing and certain basic amenities and are therefore considered in this
compendium. Other crucial social determinants of health are income or socioeconomic position, education,
employment status, job security and social support and inclusion. These are important causes of disease and
disability but are not within the scope of this compendium (10).

pollution
2.1 Introduction
The combined effects from ambient (outdoor) air pollution and indoor (household, in particular) air
pollution cause approximately 7 million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased
mortality from stroke, IHD, COPD, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections (1). Air pollution can occur
in both the outdoor and indoor environments. Cook-stoves in homes, motor vehicles, industrial facilities
and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Air pollutants with the strongest evidence for adverse
health outcomes include particulate matter (PM; both PM2.5 (i.e. particles with an aerodynamic diameter
equal to or less than 2.5 μm) and PM10 (i.e. particles with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than
10 μm), ozone (O3
), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Air pollution is
however composed of many more pollutants (1).

2.2 Ambient air pollution
This section contains the guidance to improve air quality in a location or country, information on the context
and additional tools. While in-depth local assessments are generally needed to identify the most appropriate
and efficient solutions, some lines of action are fundamental to achieve cleaner air, such as clean energy
generation and transport, sustainable consumption and sound agricultural and waste management practices.
As part of local air pollution originates from sources far from the local context, some of the required action
will go beyond the scope of the local practitioner, and will require action at another level, such as through
international activities not addressed here (2).
Many of the measures suggested also reduce those harmful emissions that lead to air pollution and climate
change, and thereby create multiple benefits. Synergies between measures to reduce air pollution and those
mitigating climate change should be actively sought when prioritizing action.
 Overview
Air pollution originates from numerous sources of emission, both natural and anthropogenic,
with the latter becoming globally dominant since the beginning of industrialization. The process
of combustion is the greatest contributor to air pollution, in particular, combustion of fossil fuels
and biomass to generate energy. Outdoor combustion sources include ground, air, and water
transport; industry and power generation; and biomass burning, which includes controlled and
uncontrolled forest and savannah fires and agricultural waste burning as well as waste burning
in urban areas. Other sources and processes contributing to outdoor pollution are re-suspension
of surface dust and construction activities. Long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants from
distant sources contributes to local pollution, particularly urban air pollution (3).
Over 90% of people live in places where the air is unhealthy to breathe, resulting in 4.2 million
deaths globally each year (2016 data). Of all deaths from ambient air pollution, 38% were due to
IHD, 20% were due to stroke and 43% were due to COPD (4, 5).
Air pollution has an especially devastating impact on children’s health and has been linked to
respiratory infections, adverse birth outcomes, adverse impacts on brain development and lung
function, obesity, asthma, otitis media, cancers and increased mortality (6, 7). Air pollution also
disproportionally affects older people.

2. Air pollution
2022 update
How polluted is the
ambient air in my
country?
When people are exposed to air pollution levels above the WHO guideline
levels, they are at increased risk of health impacts, in particular cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases and lung cancer.
The current air quality (for PM) can be informed through the following.
a. In-situ measurements: Annual mean PM2.5 is the indicator of ambient air
pollution that best predicts health impacts, and can be measured locally.
Assessment of additional indicators is also useful.3
In-situ measurements are generally provided by national or subnational
institutions. In addition, a global database, the WHO Global Ambient Air
Quality Database (8) compiles annual PM2.5 measurements for more than
4000 cities or localities in the world. In the absence of a monitoring system,
modelled satellite data or use of low-cost sensors may be considered.
b. Interactive air pollution map (9): This global interactive map shows
modelled PM2.5 annual concentration for every location, based on about
60 000 in-situ measurements.
Other indicators and their monitoring are also relevant, such as nitrogen and
sulfur dioxides, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, black and elemental
carbon and ultrafine particles. Source apportionment of PM allows for the
analysis of PM composition (e.g. with regard to sand and dust).
At national level, UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators also
monitor progress related to ambient air quality.
– SDG indicator 3.9.1: Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air
pollution (10).
– SDG indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g.
PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted) (10).
What are the main sources
contributing to ambient
air pollution?
Source apportionment studies assist in identifying the main sources
contributing to air pollution, in view of identifying efficient strategies to reduce
the pollution in the area of interest (e.g. country, district, city). Some of the
air pollution sources may be obvious, or can be assessed through other
means (such as estimation of emissions). While local sources contribute to
air pollution, sources located further away (even hundreds of kilometres, or
transboundary) are important contributors as well.
A database on source apportionment studies for airborne PM is available, and
a global review provides an overview (11, 12). Main sources of PM2.5 have also
been estimated through modelling (13).

What is the air quality we
want to achieve?
WHO air quality guidelines (3) are available for a number of pollutants and cover
concentrations of pollutants in the air for different averaging times, applicable to
both outdoor and indoor environments (Table 2.1). The interim targets shown in
Table 2.1 are proposed as incremental steps in the reduction of air pollution and
are intended for use in areas where pollution is high. Interim targets should be
regarded as steps towards ultimately achieving air quality guideline (AQG) levels,
rather than as end targets.

The air quality guideline levels recommended in previous WHO air quality
guidelines for pollutants and averaging times not covered in the 2021 update
remain valid (the reader is referred to Air quality guidelines for Europe (14), Air
quality guidelines for Europe, 2nd edition (15); and WHO guidelines for indoor air
quality: selected pollutants (16). A summary of all air quality guidelines is also
available (17).
Current evidence is insufficient for guideline levels for specific types of PM,
notably black carbon or elemental carbon, ultrafine particles and particles
originating from sand and dust storms. Good practice statements are included

2.3 Indoor air pollution:

This section covers guidance to improve the quality of air within and around household environments from
various pollutants and polluting sources. The most important source of pollution worldwide, in particular in
low- and middle-income countries,5 comes from inefficient fuel combustion for cooking, heating and lighting,
generating PM and other noxious gases. Other harmful pollutants include second-hand tobacco smoke, as
well as radon and compounds released into the air from microbial growth (moulds). This section also includes
information on the context and relevant tools for assessment and implementation.
Measures to reduce indoor air pollution from combustion sources overlap with those to reduce harmful
emissions that contribute to ambient air pollution and climate change – and thereby create multiple benefits.
Synergies between measures to reduce air pollution and those mitigating climate change should be actively
sought when prioritizing action.
Most households using unclean fuels and technologies are poor. General measures to reduce poverty often
will enable people to switch to cleaner fuels and technologies and thereby reduce their exposure to air
pollutants.
For guidance on radon, see section 6.4 Radon.

2. Air pollution
2022 update
 Overview
Almost half of the world’s population live in households polluted with smoke from cooking with
unclean fuels and technologies. Exposure is particularly high among women and young children,
who spend the most time near the domestic hearth (44). The fine PM (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10)
component of this pollution mix leads to an estimated 3.8 million deaths per year (2016 data) (5).
Of those 3.8 million deaths, 27% were due to IHD, 18% were due to stroke and 54% were due to
COPD. Household air pollution is responsible for 45% of all pneumonia deaths in children aged
under 5 years and contributes to 28% of all pneumonia deaths in adults (4, 44).
In addition, small PM and other pollutants in indoor smoke lead to airway inflammation, which
impedes normal immune function and the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (44).
Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and radon cause 1.3 million and 84 000 deaths per
year (2019 data) respectively (45).
Note: active smoking causes 7.7 million deaths per year but is not considered an environmental
risk and therefore not directly considered in this compendium.
2.3.1 Particulate matter, carbon
monoxide and other pollutants from
incomplete combustion processes
What is the proportion of
households impacted by
indoor combustion in my
country?
When people are exposed to household air pollution levels above the WHO air
quality guidelines, they are at increased risk of health impacts, in particular
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and lung cancer, cataract and adverse
pregnancy outcomes.
The proportion of households using polluting or unclean fuels and technologies
can be informed through the following.
a. Household surveys: Household surveys are used to assess the proportion
of households mainly using clean fuels and technologies used for cooking,
heating and lighting. Harmonized household energy survey questions are
available to assist in this assessment (46).
b. Global database on clean fuel and technology use (4): Energy use at
household level is monitored by an SDG indicator (10): 7.1.2 – Proportion of
population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.
WHO data on this indicator are available in this global database with
estimates of the proportion of the population cooking with clean fuels and
technologies by country, based on recent household surveys; this database
is used for SDG reporting (47).
c. Global household energy database (48): WHO maintains an exhaustive
database that compiles all nationally representative survey data on fuels
and technologies used for cooking, heating and lighting. 
Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment
20 2022 update
What is the proportion of
households impacted by
indoor combustion in my
country?
Conducting field measurements of household air pollution is not required
(although encouraged); use of the resources above to ascertain the extent of
polluting fuel use for cooking should be sufficient to motivate action to expand
clean household energy in the home. However, if there is interest in monitoring
the level of household air pollution, this can be assessed through the following.
a. In-situ measurements: Guidance on how to collect household and personal
PM2.5
6 and carbon monoxide measurements is provided by WHO (49).
b. Global database of household air pollution measurements (50): This
database contains household air pollution measurements (household and/
or personal measurements) collected in hundreds of studies.
What is the contribution
of residential biomass
burning to ambient air
pollution?
The contribution of domestic fuel burning to ambient air pollution can be
estimated through source apportionment studies.
A database on source apportionment studies for airborne PM is available, and
a global review provides an overview (11, 12).
What is the indoor air
quality we want to
achieve?
WHO air quality guidelines are available for a number of pollutants and cover
concentrations of pollutants in the air. Worldwide, the most important indoor air
health hazard originates from PM due to combustion. Health-based guideline
values include the following maximum values and interim targets (Table 2.2).
Interim targets are proposed as incremental steps in the reduction of air pollution
and are intended for use in areas where pollution is high (3). Interim targets
should be regarded as steps towards ultimately achieving AQG levels, rather than
as end targets.

2022 update
What is the proportion
of people impacted by
second-hand tobacco
smoke in my country?
Current exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke can be informed through the
following.
– National and regional household surveys.
– WHO STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) (66).
The STEPS approach is a simple, standardized method for collecting,
analysing and disseminating data on NCDs and risk factors.
– Global Burden of Disease estimates attributable to second-hand tobacco
smoke (45).
What levels of exposure
to second-hand tobacco
smoke do we want to
achieve?
There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. Only 100% smoke-free
indoor environments are the single proven way to protect health (64).
Note: “Indoor” areas include any space covered by a roof or enclosed by one or
more walls or sides, regardless of the type of material used for the roof, wall or
sides, and regardless of whether the structure is permanent or temporary (67).
2.3.2 Second-hand tobacco smoke
This section particularly relates to the exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, often referred to as
passive smoking. Specific guidance on active smoking and related interventions can be found on the WHO
website (61).
 Overview
Exposure to tobacco smoke in the environment is proven to cause cardiovascular, respiratory and
other diseases, killing more than 1.3 million people each year (2019 data) (45, 62).
Active smoking causes 7.7 million deaths per year (2019 data) but is not considered an
environmental risk and therefore not directly considered in this compendium (45).
The toxic mix in tobacco smoke contains thousands of known chemicals, including at least 250
known carcinogenic or toxic agents (63), similar to those from other incomplete combustion
processes and additional ones that are specific to tobacco smoke. This smoke is also often
measured in particulate matter. Children and infants are particularly susceptible to second-hand
smoke, and are at increased risk for respiratory disease, middle ear disease and sudden infant
death syndrome (64).
Moreover, tobacco production adversely impacts human health by creating waste and inflicting
damage on the environment across its entire life cycle, including via agricultural practices of
cultivating and curing tobacco, tobacco product manufacturing, transportation and distribution,
as well as post-consumption waste, such as cigarette butts and toxic third-hand smoke materials –
chemical residue of tobacco smoke on surfaces (65).

2.3.3 Dampness and mould
This section summarizes measures to control mould growth indoors. The most important means for avoiding
adverse health effects is the prevention (or minimization) of persistent dampness and microbial growth on
interior surfaces and in building structures.
 Overview
Indoor moisture can lead to microbial pollution caused by hundreds of species of bacteria and
fungi, in particular filamentous fungi (mould), growing indoors. The most important effects are
increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms, allergies and asthma as well as perturbation of the
immunological system.
What is the indoor air
quality we want to
achieve?
Persistent dampness and microbial growth on interior surfaces and in building
structures should be avoided or minimized, as they may lead to adverse health
effects (82).
Additional information, including on other pollutants, is available: WHO
guidelines for indoor air quality: dampness and mould (82).

3.1 Introduction
Safe WASH are crucial to human health and well-being. Safe WASH are not only a prerequisite to health,
but contribute to livelihoods, school attendance and dignity and help to create resilient communities living
in healthy environments (1).
Inadequate or unsafe WASH may cause disease through a range of interrelated transmission pathways,
which include among others:
• ingestion of water that is contaminated with faeces or chemicals
• inadequate personal hygiene which may be linked to lack of water
• contact with pathogen-containing water
• proximity to water bodies where disease vectors proliferate (2).
An estimated 829 000 diarrhoeal disease deaths were estimated to be caused by unsafe WASH in
2016. Other diseases caused by inadequate WASH include among others acute respiratory infections,
malnutrition, malaria, soil-transmitted helminth infections, schistosomiasis and trachoma (3). In addition,
environmental enteropathy, a chronic subclinical inflammatory condition of the gut, which is related to
faecal contamination of the environment, might be a key mediating pathway for adverse effects on child
nutritional and developmental status from inadequate WASH (4, 5).

3.2 Water
3.2.1 Drinking-water
This section focuses on water that is used for drinking, though safe water is essential also for other
domestic purposes and food production (6). Safe water used for recreational purposes is treated in section
3.2.2 Recreational water.
 Overview
As of 2020, 26% of the worldwide population lack safely managed drinking-water services.
Approximately 144 million people still collect drinking-water directly from surface water.
Contaminated drinking-water is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year, in
addition to malnutrition and many other diseases (3, 7, 8).
Note: A safely managed drinking-water service is defined as being accessible on premises,
available when needed and free from contamination.
What is the situation in
terms of drinking-water
supply and drinkingwater quality in my
country?
Most countries monitor access to safe water and progress in improving it. This
is usually performed through surveys of households, schools and health care
facilities, as well as through routine water quality surveillance.
At national and global levels, SDG monitoring includes indicators related to
drinking-water (9):
• SDG indicator 3.9.2: Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe
sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH) services).
• SDG indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed
drinking-water services.
WHO and UNICEF, through the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply,
Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), serve as custodian agencies for the global
monitoring of these WASH indicators in the framework of measuring progress
towards the SDGs (1).

What is the level of
drinking-water quality
and safety we want to
achieve?
WHO produces guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) that form the
basis for national drinking-water regulations and standards (10). The GDWQ
cover a broad range of chemicals, pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites,
radioactive substances and aspects of taste, odour and appearance that can
affect drinking-water quality. The GDWQ provide health-based targets for over
200 parameters.
WHO guidance on water quality parameters and safe limits is presented within
a broader framework for safe drinking-water, which addresses the following.
• Health-based targets: These include parameters with associated
limits (such as those included in drinking-water quality regulations and
standards). Health-based targets that include chemical guideline values
in the GDWQ can be used to establish country-specific targets. Guideline
values generally represent a concentration of a parameter in drinkingwater that does not represent a significant risk to health over a lifetime of
consumption.
• Water safety plans (WSPs): These are part of a comprehensive risk
assessment and risk management approach that encompass all steps of
water supply from catchment to consumer.
• Independent surveillance: This refers to the continuous and vigilant
public health assessment and review of drinking-water supplies to confirm
effective risk management and safety.

Policies and actions
1. Develop or update drinking-water quality regulations and
standards (10, 11).
National (or subnational) drinking-water regulations and
standards should be based on the GDWQ, incorporating the three
components of the framework for safe drinking-water. Regulations
should be customized to consider local needs, priorities and
capacities, as well as the economic and health benefits resulting
from improved drinking-water supplies.
Suggested practical steps for developing/revising drinking-water
quality regulations and standards are:
• identify the lead institution
• define roles to support the process
• define objectives and scope of the regulations and standards
• review existing regulations and standards
• gather baseline data for analysis
• prepare the separate sections of the regulations and
standards
• ensure peer review.
These steps are further detailed in Developing drinking-water
quality regulations and standards (11), with a particular focus on
taking a risk-based approach to establishing parameters, limits
and monitoring requirements.

2. Protect drinking-water supplies using WSPs (12).
Proactive management of risks to drinking-water supplies through
WSPs should be promoted at national (or subnational) level, with
related support (e.g. capacity building) provided to drinking-water
suppliers.
A WSP involves the following steps.
(a) Assemble the team.
(b) Describe the water supply system.
(c) Identify hazards and hazardous events and assess the risk.
(d) Determine and validate control measures and reassess the risk.
(e) Develop, implement and maintain an upgrade/improvement plan.
(f) Define monitoring of control measures.
(g) Verify the effectiveness of the WSP.
(h) Prepare management procedures.
(i) Develop supporting programmes.
(j) Plan and carry out periodic review of the WSP.
(k) Revise the WSP following an incident.
These WSP steps are further detailed in the Water safety plan
manual: step-by-step risk management for drinking-water suppliers
(13) with an alternative six-task approach for small water supply
systems (14) (see also the “Special considerations for small water
supply systems” section below.) Guidance on the systematic
consideration of women and disadvantaged groups through the
WSP process in order to ensure equitable benefit is also available
(15). Additional practical guidance on WSPs is available in the
various resources outlined in Water safety planning: a roadmap to
supporting resources (10).
Guidance on applying the WSP approach to identify and manage
the impacts of climate variability and change on drinking-water
systems is presented in Chapter 7. Climate change.

3. Confirm water safety through independent surveillance (10).
Surveillance provides independent verification that drinking-water
supplies are safe and water suppliers are proactively managing
risks. Surveillance includes:
• direct testing to confirm compliance with drinking-water
quality standards;
• WSP auditing or sanitary inspection to confirm effective risk
management;
• review of supplier monitoring records to confirm that
compliance monitoring practices and results are in
accordance with requirements in drinking-water quality
standards.
Guidance on surveillance is provided in Chapter 5 of the
GDWQ and volume 3 of the GDWQ: surveillance and control of
community supplies (10, 16). Guidance on establishing WSP audit
schemes and carrying out audits is provided in A practical guide
to auditing water safety plans (17). An associated training package
on WSP auditing is available (18).

4. For the management of chemicals in drinking-water, including
cyanotoxins, the key components of the GDWQ framework for
safe drinking-water should be applied. This includes selecting
which priority parameters to include in drinking-water quality
regulations (and associated limits), taking management actions
to reduce concentrations of these contaminants as part of WSPs,
and monitoring as part of surveillance. Refer to the GDWQ (10) and
Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards (11).
The WSP approach can be adapted to manage pharmaceuticals
and microplastics by preventing their entry, or the entry of their
precursors, in the water cycle. This could include improved
recycling programmes and minimizing inappropriate disposal.
These contaminants have the potential to reach drinking-water,
although the concentrations generally found in drinking-water or
its sources are unlikely to pose a risk to human health. Therefore,
routine monitoring of these contaminants is not necessary and
concerns over these emerging contaminants should not divert
resources from known dangers, including removing of microbial
pathogens (19).

5. For the management of radioactivity in drinking-water in
non-emergency situations the key components of the GDWQ
framework for safe drinking-water should be applied, as
described above.
Radionuclides in drinking-water generally present a very low
health risk compared to microbial pathogens and chemicals.
Radiation exposure through drinking-water in normal situations
mostly results from naturally occurring rather than human-made
radionuclides. In contrast, following radiation emergencies
involving radioactive release, human-made radionuclides may
represent the major source of exposure. These factors should
be considered for establishing criteria included in drinkingwater quality regulations, management actions and surveillance
activities (see section 6.5 Radioactivity in food and drinking-water
and 6.6 Radiological emergencies) (10, 20-22).

Special considerations for small water supply systems
7. Consider the special needs, challenges and opportunities for
small water supply systems when applying the framework for safe
drinking-water (10).
Small water supply systems tend to share a common set of
characteristics that set them apart from other systems. For
instance, there are often great numbers of systems covering a
large geographic spread (including remote locations); limited
technical and financial support; reliance on undertrained and/or
unpaid staff; and limited surveillance oversight and support.
Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards (11)
offers considerations for small systems and other settings with
limited resources, and water safety planning for small community
water supplies (14) presents a simplified six-task WSP approach
for the small systems context (which is an abridged version of the
11-module approach outlined in point 2 above). See volume 3 of the
GDWQ: surveillance and control of community supplies (16) and the
associated sanitary inspection forms for further guidance (24).

 Overview
Recreational use of fresh and coastal waters as well as waters in swimming pools and similar
environments can deliver important benefits to health and well-being such as physical activity,
relaxation, cultural and religious use. Yet, recreational water use can pose risks to health through
exposure to microbial and chemical pollution as well as physical risk such as Drowning and injury.
What is the status of
recreational water
quality in my country?
Most high-income countries and some middle-income countries monitor safety
of recreational water sites with the purpose of identifying and addressing
pollution sources and providing water users with timely information on whether
it is safe to enter.
At national and global levels, SDG monitoring includes indicators related to,
but not directly assessing, water quality of water bodies used for recreation (9).
• SDG indicator 6.3.1: Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flow
safely treated.
• SDG indicator 6.3.2: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water
quality.
WHO and UN-HABITAT serve as custodian agencies monitoring that
wastewater is safely treated globally and UNEP is the custodian agency for
monitoring ambient water quality globally (32).
What is the level of
recreational water
safety we want to
achieve?
WHO produces guidelines for recreational water in two volumes: Guidelines on
recreational water quality. Volume 1: coastal and fresh waters and Guidelines
for safe recreational water environments. Volume 2: swimming pools and similar
environments (33, 34). These guidelines focus on water quality-related health
hazards for the general population engaging in all type of recreational water
use involving contact with water and beach sand.
WHO guidance on recreational water quality parameters and safe limits is
presented within a broader recreational water safety framework including three
core recommendations for coastal and fresh water (as listed in Tables 3.1–3.3).

2. Develop and implement recreational WSPs for priority bathing
sites (33). Steps for developing an RWSP include the following.
a. Identify the lead entity and assemble a team to develop the
recreational WSP. This includes identifying the lead entity and key
stakeholders and forming a coordination committee that includes
relevant stakeholders with clear roles and responsibilities.
b. Undertake a system assessment for each existing priority
recreational water site (or group of sites within the same
catchment) and before developing new sites.
• Describe the recreational water environment – by combining
a sanitary survey of adjacent land and water drainage with
an initial microbial quality assessment to assign a beach
classification.
• Identify hazards and hazardous events, considering
seasonality and predicted local climate change scenarios.
• Assess and prioritize the risks.
• Identify existing control measures, assess risks and prioritize
risks that are insufficiently controlled.
• Establish plans, with sustainable funding, for managing
currently effective control measures.
• Establish improvement plans, with sustainable funding, for
incrementally implementing control measures where priority
risks are insufficiently controlled.
c. Conduct and maintain system monitoring.
• Establish and implement an operational monitoring regime
for priority control measures in the catchment to give rapid
warning when operational limits are exceeded.
• Establish and implement corrective actions for exceedances
of operational limits.
• Conduct ongoing verification monitoring of water quality.
• Establish procedures to verify effectiveness of the
recreational WSP.

(SOPs), quality control activities, procedures for visual
inspections, sample collection and equipment calibration.
• Establish communication protocols between responsible
organizations and agencies.
• Establish mechanisms for communication with users and
managers of the site.
e. Review and update recreational WSPs. This includes meeting
periodically and after incidents to review performance of plans,
including operational monitoring and water quality results, an
updated sanitary survey and beach classification, the occurrence
of incidents, communication and complaints; if necessary,
update the risk assessment.
More information is provided in the Guidelines on recreational water
quality. Volume 1: coastal and fresh waters (33).
3. Conduct ongoing surveillance and risk communication of
recreational water-related illness (33).
• Collect, analyse and interpret health-related data on
suspected or confirmed illness in humans and/or animals,
and systematically document outbreaks associated with
recreational waters.
• Provide the public with timely information about the status
of health risks, and provide water users with advisory
warnings before, during and after a public health incident, in
conjunction with recreational WSPs.

3.3 Sanitation
 Overview
Nearly half the world’s population lacked safely managed sanitation services in 2020. Such
deficiencies cause 432 000 diarrhoeal disease deaths globally each year (2016), and also lead
to soil-transmitted helminth infections, malnutrition and numerous other diseases (3, 7, 8). Poor
sanitation contributes to the spread of antimicrobial resistance and negatively affects broader
well-being (36).
Benefits of improving sanitation extend well beyond reducing the risk of diarrhoea and other
diseases and include among others increased dignity and safety, particularly among women and
girls, and increased school attendance.
Evidence suggests that simply improving sanitation facilities might not lead to the desired health
impacts but needs to be accompanied with the safe disposal of children’s and animal faeces, and
the cessation of open defecation (37).
Who has inadequate
sanitation in my
country?
Most countries are monitoring progress on access to safe sanitation. This is
usually performed through surveys of households, and also schools and health
care facilities.
At national level, SDG indicators also monitor progress related to sanitation (9):
– SDG indicator 3.9.2: Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe
sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene for All (WASH)).
– SDG indicator 6.2.1: Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation
services, including a handwashing facility with soap and water.
– SDG indicator 6.3.1: Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flow
safely treated.
Chapters 3 and 4 of the WHO Guidelines on sanitation and health provide
definitions of safely managed sanitation for all steps of the chain (toilet,
containment, conveyance, treatment, disposal/end use) and good practice
advice on translating definitions into national targets, policies, regulations and
monitoring systems.
What do we want to
achieve in terms of
sanitation services to
protect people’s health?
Safe sanitation systems should be designed and used to separate human
excreta from human contact at all steps of the sanitation service chain from
toilet capture and containment, through emptying, transport, treatment (insitu or offsite) and final disposal or end use.
The WHO Guidelines on sanitation and health (38) provide guidance to
maximize the health impact of sanitation interventions including preventing
infections and maintaining mental and social well-being through four main
recommendations: i) ensuring universal access to and use of toilets that
safely contain excreta among entire communities, institutions, workplaces
and public places; ii) ensuring universal access to safe systems along the
entire sanitation service chain based on context-specific solutions and local
health risk assessment to protect the health of individuals, communities and
workers; iii) integrating sanitation into regular local government-led planning
and service provision; and iv) ensuring the health sector fulfil core functions to
ensure sanitation interventions effectively protect public health.

Examples include the following.
• Toilets should be made of durable material that can be easily
cleaned, provide safety and privacy, with facilities for anal
cleansing, hand washing and menstrual hygiene management.
• Ensure safe containment of faecal waste through adequate
design, operation and maintenance.
• Use motorized emptying and transport over manual emptying
and transport wherever possible, implement SOPs and health
and safety measures for workers.
• Ensure adequate treatment of faecal waste before end use/
disposal.
• Ensure multi-barrier approach is used along the entire service
chain.

3.4 Personal hygiene
Because of its proven health benefits, hand washing with soap and water (46) is usually the top priority for
both health promotion and hygiene monitoring.
This section focuses on individual hygiene behaviours in different settings and covers mainly hand hygiene
but also other aspects of personal hygiene such as face washing. It does not address hygiene in health care
facilities, which is included in the section on health care facilities (section 11.4 Health care facilities).
 Overview
Hygiene is multi-faceted and comprises many behaviours, including hand- and face washing,
menstrual hygiene and food hygiene. Hand washing with soap at crucial events such as after
visiting the toilet, defecating or before preparing food was estimated to be a poorly practised
behaviour globally (47).
Approximately 2.3 billion people lacked functioning hand-washing facilities with water and soap in
2020 (7). Inadequate hygiene behaviours are an important risk factor for infectious diseases like
diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infections, respiratory diseases and contribute to malnutrition
and other diseases; they were estimated to have caused 165 000 deaths from diarrhoea alone in
2016 (3, 8).
Who has inadequate
access to basic hygiene
facilities in my country?
Direct assessment of hand-washing practices is usually considered too
resource-intensive, especially at national level. Personal hygiene practices can
be estimated by the proportion of people with access to hand-washing facilities
with soap and water on premises (basic hand-washing facilities). Access
to basic hand-washing facilities is usually assessed in large and nationally
representative household surveys. Survey data on access to hand-washing
facilities are also available for individual countries for schools and health care
facilities (1).
Progress related to hygiene and improved hand washing with soap is also
assessed within the SDGs (9). SDG 6 includes a target of adequate and
equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. SDG indicators specifically mentioning
hygiene or hand washing with soap include the following.
• SDG indicator 3.9.2: Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe
sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene for All (WASH)).
• SDG indicator 4.A.1: Proportion of schools with access to: […] (e) basic
drinking-water; (f) single-sex basic sanitation facilities; and (g) basic
handwashing facilities (as per the WASH indicator definitions).
• SDG indicator 6.2.1: Proportion of population using safely managed
sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water.
What do we want to
achieve in terms of
personal hygiene?
Everyone should have access to basic hygiene facilities at home, at school, at
the workplace and in public buildings (38). Hand washing should be practised
with soap and water and at crucial events such as after visiting the toilet,
defecating or before preparing food (38, 48).

4. Solid waste
Solid waste management starts from generation to collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste.
Challenges of solid waste management encompass for example poor waste collection and improper
disposal such as in uncontrolled dumpsites with no measures to protect soil or groundwater.
This section includes municipal and electronic waste (e-waste); health care and medical waste is
included in section 11.4 Health care facilities. Interventions on health care waste can be found in section
11.4 Health care facilities.
 Overview
Solid waste refers to any type of garbage, trash, refuse or discarded material. It can be categorized
according to where the waste is generated, for example as municipal solid waste, health care
waste and e-waste. Over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste are produced annually (1, 2).
Improper disposal can lead to adverse health outcomes, for example through water, soil and air
contamination. Hazardous waste or unsafe waste treatment such as open burning can directly
harm waste workers or other people involved in waste burning and neighbouring communities.
Vulnerable groups such as children are at increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Poor waste
collection leads to environmental and marine pollution and can block water drains. Resulting
flooding and other standing waters in waste items favour cholera and vector-borne diseases such
as malaria and dengue (1).
About 54 million tons of e-waste, such as TVs, computers and phones, are created annually
(2019 data) with an expected increase to 75 million tons by 2030. In 2019 only 17% of e-waste
was documented as being properly collected and recycled (3). Exposure to improperly managed
e-waste and its components can cause multiple adverse health and developmental impacts
especially in young children (4).

What is the situation
regarding solid waste in
my country?
Municipal solid waste
SDG indicator 11.6.1 monitors progress related to safe waste management:
Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final
discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities.
E-waste
The Global E-Waste Statistics Partnership monitors development related to
e-waste and assists countries in producing their own e-waste statistics (5).
What do we want to
achieve?
A safe management system for solid waste
A solid waste management system includes different components: waste
generation, collection, transport, treatment and disposal. Solid waste
management is a key budgetary expenditure for many local governments,
is important for economic and social development and protects the health
of especially the most vulnerable populations. Regulating and formalizing
informal structures play a crucial role in providing safe waste management
systems including for hazardous waste.
Reduced waste generation
Reduction of the amount of solid waste generated following the three-tiered
approach (the 3 R’s) to managing solid waste:
1. reduce
2. reuse
3. recycle.
The 3 R’s are part of the waste management hierarchy (Fig. 4.1), which ranks
waste management options or interventions starting from the most favoured
(reduce) to the least favoured (disposal) (1).

5. Chemicals
5. Chemicals
5.1 Introduction
More than 160 million chemicals are known to humans (1). About 40 000 to 60 000 of them can be found
in commerce; 6000 of these account for more than 99% of the total volume of chemicals in commerce
globally (2). In 2017, the chemical industry was the second largest manufacturing industry in the world and
the trend is going upwards – chemicals sales are projected to almost double from 2017 to 2030 (3).
Chemicals, whether of natural origin or produced by human activities, are part of our environment.
Manufactured chemicals include industrial and agricultural products such as pesticides, petroleum products
and processed metals. Some chemicals are manufactured for specific uses, while others are unwanted
by-products, including wastes, or products of combustion such as toxic gases and particles from industrial
emissions and burning of fuel.
All people come in contact with chemicals as part of normal life – through the food and drinking-water they
consume, the products they use or are surrounded by at home or the workplace, through the contact with the
environment (e.g. through breathing air, touching the soil, and swimming in recreational waters) or as a result
of a chemical incident. Many of the chemicals people use and are exposed to are harmless or even beneficial;
others pose a threat and are hazardous to people’s health and the environment. Levels of exposure and
resulting health impacts are determined by social as well as biological factors. Men, women and children are
exposed to different kinds and levels of chemicals and are exposed with different frequency. In addition, men,
women and children vary in their physiological susceptibility to health effects from exposure to hazardous
chemicals (4).
Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment

5.2 Chemical safety
In May 2017, the Seventieth World Health Assembly approved the Chemicals road map to enhance health
sector engagement in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) (5).
The road map identifies concrete actions where the health sector in countries has a lead or important
supporting role to play in the sound management of chemicals, recognizing the need for multisectoral
cooperation. An important role of the health sector is to make a contribution to reducing health risks
from exposures to chemicals by promoting health protection strategies, regulating chemicals, increasing
public education, and sharing information and best practices. In doing so, the role of the health sector
is to increase knowledge and evidence about the toxicological properties of chemicals and related
human health risks and impacts. Another role of the health sector is to promote the inclusion of health
considerations in all chemicals policies including those developed by other sectors.
At the national level, countries usually have in place laws to ensure the safe handling of chemicals and
to protect the environment, consumers and workers from contamination by and exposure to hazardous
chemicals. In addition, laws are in place to prevent, prepare and respond to chemical incidents,
including accidents at hazardous installations (e.g. chemical plants) and during transport. Regulations
specify classification, labelling, packaging and transport of hazardous materials, including hazardous
chemicals (6). National laws also define chemical emission and quality standards, for example permitted
concentration of chemicals in air, water, food and consumer products. Specific laws regulate the
management of groups of chemicals, for example the management of pesticides.
 Overview
In 2019, a small number of chemicals for which data are available were estimated to cause
2 million deaths from a variety of health outcomes including poisonings, heart diseases, chronic
respiratory diseases and cancers (7). Chemical pollution also negatively impacts a range of facets
of the ecosystem, which can harm human health.
Some hazardous chemicals are of particular health concern because of their widespread presence
in the environment, their toxicity and capacity to magnify and accumulate in environmental and
human media, and the fact that many humans easily come in contact with them thereby harming
the health of large populations. Chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern
include air pollution, arsenic, asbestos, benzene, cadmium, dioxin and dioxin-like substances,
inadequate or excess fluoride, lead, mercury and highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs) (8). 
65
5. Chemicals
Who is impacted
by unsafe levels of
chemicals in my
country?
Exposure of the general population
Some countries routinely conduct population surveys to study the status
and trend of chemical exposures (e.g. through the environment, food, and
consumer products) and the related health risks of (sub-) populations.
Often chemical exposure is determined by human bio-monitoring, that is,
concentrations of chemicals are measured in human fluids (e.g. blood, urine)
or tissues (e.g. hair, fingernail) (9, 10).
Exposure through air, water and food
Mandatory environmental and food monitoring programmes routinely
measure chemicals in certain contexts, for example ambient and indoor air,
surface and groundwater, and various food items, as well as in occupational
environments. Often these programmes focus on monitoring specific
chemicals indicating a broader exposure pattern and, therefore, the range of
substances being monitored may be limited (see Chapter 2 Air pollution and
sections 3.2.1 Drinking-water, 10.1 Food safety and the environment, and
11.3 Workplaces). Environmental monitoring data provide an estimate of the
health risks when compared to the WHO air quality guidelines 2005 update and
WHO GDWQ (11, 12). Food monitoring data of pesticide residues, food additives
and contaminates can be compared with the guidance values (e.g. Acceptable
Daily Intakes prepared by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food
Additives and the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (13-15).
Exposure through soil
In soils, chemicals are generally only assessed when contamination is
suspected, for example in the case of an abandoned waste site where there
is a pollution risk to groundwater. Activities and industries that have shown to
pollute soil include used lead acid battery recycling, mining and ore processing,
tanneries, dumpsites, industrial estates, smelting, artisanal small-scale gold
mining, product manufacturing, chemical manufacturing and the dye industry.
What levels of chemicals
in the air, water,
products, etc. do we
want to achieve?
Chemicals in air: WHO air quality guidelines are available for a number of
pollutants and are presented in concentrations of pollutants in the air:
particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide in ambient air,
and additional chemicals in indoor air (12, 16) (see Chapter 2 Air pollution).
Chemicals in drinking-water: WHO drinking-water quality guidelines propose
guideline values for a wide variety of chemicals (11).
Chemicals in soil: Some countries have set standards for contaminants in soils
in residential areas and for farming and crop production.
Chemicals in food: WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) implement the Codex Alimentarius, which is a collection
of standards, guidelines and codes of practice on foods and their contents,
including chemical contaminants and food additives (15, 17, 18).
Additional guidance and guideline values (e.g. occupational exposure
limits) can be found in Environmental Health Criteria Documents, Concise
International Chemical Assessment or International Chemical Safety Cards
(ICSCs) – all are available in the International Programme on Chemical Safety
(INCHEM) database (9) and in the Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound
Management of Chemicals (IOMC) Internet-based Toolbox for Decision Making
in Chemicals Management (IOMC Toolbox) (19).

5. Chemicals
This section focuses on incidents of chemical and radiological nature. The section Selected tools contains
information relating to natural disasters and environmental health services during emergencies.
 Overview
Chemical events arising from technological incidents, natural disasters, conflict and terrorism,
polluted environments, and contaminated foods and products are common and occur worldwide.
Between 2000 and 2020, there were over 1000 technological incidents involving chemicals
worldwide, affecting over 1.85 million people (76).
Some chemical incidents can have international consequences, for example when a chemicallycontaminated product is distributed to multiple countries or when a chemical release
contaminates an environmental medium such as air or water and subsequently traverses national
borders (77). It then falls under the IHR (2005) (20). Under IHR (2005), Member States must
have in place the necessary capacities to detect, evaluate and respond to public health events
caused by any hazard, including chemicals. WHO, in turn, should provide assistance on request to
Member States for investigating and controlling such events.
How do we assess
a chemical (or
radiological) incident?
Many chemical incidents are overt and are quickly recognized, such as a fire
or large leak from a chemical plant. Some chemical releases may, however,
only become apparent with the presentation or reporting of a number of cases
with similar signs and symptoms, with common histories and linked in time and
space. The timely identification of the cause of clusters or suspected outbreaks
associated with exposure to chemicals may require a detailed investigation
involving clinical, toxicological, epidemiological, environmental and laboratory
analytical approaches.
Provided they are adequately resourced, poison centres can play a key role in
identifying chemical incidents, and in supporting assessment and response. They
are centres of expertise on clinical toxicology and have access to databases on
products and substances. Most poison centres perform toxicovigilance, that is,
they are engaged in the active process of identifying and assessing the toxic risks
from exposure in a community or population to consumer products, pesticides,
pharmaceuticals, environmental and industrial chemicals, controlled substances
and natural toxins. Toxicovigilance involves the monitoring of data from poison
centres to identify trends in poisoning exposures and the emergence of new risks
associated with toxic substances (65, 78).

What do we want to
achieve?
Comprehensive management of chemical incidents requires prevention and
preparedness, early detection and effective response and recovery.
Prevention focuses on general measures that can be taken to diminish the
likelihood of a chemical incident and to limit its severity.
Emergency planning and preparedness details broad goals that can be
accomplished to ensure adequate public health preparedness of all involved
parties to respond to a chemical incident.
Detection and alert describes various channels that can be used to detect
a chemical incident and to alter the response of stakeholders involved in a
chemical event emergency.
Response deals with the public health tasks that should be carried out during
an emergency.
Recovery details the methods used to evaluate the causes and responses
to chemical incidents and to follow up the victims in order to learn from the
experience of incidents and near incidents, and to restore and remediate the
affected environment (79, 80).
Acute chemical exposure guidelines are available from countries, including
Acute Exposure Guideline Levels and the Immediately Dangerous To Life or
Health values.

 Overview
Human exposure to solar UV radiation may result in acute and chronic health effects of the skin
(such as skin cancers) the eye (such as cataracts) and the immune system. All skin types can be
affected (1, 2). Natural UV radiation levels depend on sun elevation, latitude and altitude, cloud
cover and ground reflection. More than 60 000 skin melanoma-related deaths were estimated to
be caused by solar UV radiation in the year 2000 (3).
Exposures can occur through UV radiation from the sun, but also from sunbeds and other artificial
tanning devices. While all populations are potentially at risk, specific subpopulations such as
children, outdoor workers and fair skinned people are at particular risk of skin cancer.
What exposure levels to
UV radiation do we want
to achieve?
Only small amounts of UV radiation are beneficial for people and essential in the
production of vitamin D. The UV index can assist to make healthy choices about
the level of sun protection needed (4).

6. Radiation
 Overview
EMF covered in this section include those generated by consumer products (electric appliances,
mobile phones), fixed installations (power lines, base stations, TV antennas, medical devices
(e.g. those using magnetic resonance imaging) and other technologies which can be found in the
environment, at the workplace and in health care facilities.
What EMF exposure
levels do we want to
achieve?
Exposure standards for EMF generally refer to maximum levels of exposure
to the body. Such standards have been developed by the International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)8, and the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE/ICES),9 as well as many national
authorities. WHO provides a framework which can be used to develop national
standards (9).

6.3 Radiation exposures
in health care
 Overview
Every year, millions of patients globally benefit from medical uses of radiation. Because of the
risks associated with radiation exposure, enhancing access to radiation technologies should
be linked to building capacity to their safe and appropriate utilization. A balanced approach is
required to maximize the benefits while minimizing risks for patients, health care workers and
members of the public.
Policies and interventions are needed to ensure that radiation safety standards (12) are applied
and that guidance and tools are available for health facilities utilizing radiation for diagnostic
and/or therapeutic purposes (13, 14). Radiation protection should be integrated into policies
and actions to improve quality of care, thus providing a framework for intersectoral cooperation
involving all relevant stakeholders.
What radiation exposure
levels do we want to
achieve in medical
settings?
Justification and optimization are the two fundamental principles of radiation
protection in medicine. Medical exposures must result in a sufficient benefit
to the patient, based on a benefit–risk analysis that provides the basis for
the justification of radiological medical procedures. To ensure optimization
of protection and safety, the design and construction of equipment and
installations as well as the protocols and working procedures applied should
result in the minimum patient dose required to achieve the clinical purpose
and the probability of errors/incidents should be minimized. While dose limits
are not applied to medical exposures, annual radiation dose limits are applied
to health workers and members of the public. Further information on radiation
safety in health care settings can be found on the WHO web site: https://www.
who.int/activities/enhancing-radiation-safety-in-health-care. Description of
guidance, examples of policies and practices, as well as of awareness raising
and capacity building interventions are provided in section 11.4 Health care
facilities under “Radiation”.

6. Radiation
6.4 Radon
 Overview
Radon is a radioactive gas that emanates from uranium in rocks and soils and tends to
concentrate in enclosed spaces such as buildings and underground mines. It can also be
present in water and in some building materials. Radon causes increased risk of lung cancer.
A combination of smoking and indoor radon gas further increases the cancer risk. Exposure to
radon causes 84 000 deaths per year (2019 data) (15).
How polluted are indoor
environments with
radon?
The air concentration of radon can be informed through the following.
– In-situ measurements: devices for measuring radon levels in homes are
available and measurements should comply with prevailing (national)
protocols (16).
– Radon maps: several countries/regions have created radon maps and
databases (16).
What are the indoor
radon levels we want to
achieve?
To limit the risk to individuals, a national reference level of 100 Bq/m3 is
recommended. Wherever this is not possible, the chosen level should not
exceed 300 Bq/m3 (16, 17).
Additional information is available.

6.5 Radioactivity in food and
drinking-water
 Overview
Food and drinking-water can contain radioactive substances (radionuclides) that could present
a risk to human health. The radiation exposure resulting from ingestion of radionuclides makes a
contribution to the overall population radiation dose from the many different natural and humanmade radiation sources of radiation found in our everyday lives. Foods and drinking-water can
have a considerable range in variation of radionuclide concentrations, reflecting the radionuclide
content of water, rocks, soil and fertilizers from where they originated and the prevalent
circumstances (e.g. normal situations vs radiation emergencies).
What are the radiation
exposure levels we want
to achieve in food and
drinking-water?
In normal circumstances, natural radionuclides are the major source of
exposure through ingestion, and the radiation risks are usually small compared
with the risks from microorganisms and chemicals that may be present in
food and drinking-water. Following radiation emergencies, human-made
radionuclides released into the environment may be transferred to food and
water and represent a significant source of exposure. These factors should
be considered for establishing criteria for food and water safety regulation,
management and surveillance. In normal situations, the International Basic
Safety Standards require that the national relevant regulatory authorities
establish specific reference levels for radiation exposure due to radionuclides
in food and drinking-water, each of which shall typically be expressed as, or
based on, an annual effective dose to the representative person generally that
does not exceed a value of about 1 mSv (12). Specific standards for response
to nuclear and radiological emergencies include criteria for management of
radioactivity in food and drinking-water (23). Further guidance on radioactivity
in food and drinking-water has been developed by WHO and other international
organizations (22, 24-26); for further information specifically related to
drinking-water, see section 3.2.1 Drinking-water.

6.6 Radiological emergencies
IHR (2005) have established provisions and requirements for countries to be prepared for radiological and
nuclear emergencies, and be able to detect, assess and respond to a crisis (27). WHO, in turn, should provide
technical assistance on request to Member States for assessment and management of risks, as well as for a
long-term recovery process.
For radioactivity in drinking-water, please refer to section 6.5 Radioactivity in food and drinking-water and
section 3.2.1 Drinking-water.
 Overview
Radiation emergencies (including radiological and nuclear emergencies) may result from
technological incidents, natural disasters, transport accidents, acts of terrorism, polluted
environments, and may involve over-exposure from external sources or internally from
contaminated air, drinking-water, foods and products. Large-scale nuclear accidents such as
those that occurred in Chernobyl or Fukushima are rare but may affect millions and have global
consequences.

6. Radiation
Detection, monitoring,
and assessing risk of
radiation emergencies
In most countries, the responsibility for monitoring radioactivity and detecting
radiation emergencies rests with specialized competent authorities (e.g.
radiation protection or nuclear safety agencies) and environmental protection
agencies. In case of an industrial accident, the operator of the facility will notify
the competent authorities, which in turn will notify the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) under the international convention for early notification
in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency (28). For other
accidents not involving licensed activities – such as human over-exposure
from a lost radioactive source or due to a malevolent act – health specialists
may be the first to identify a cluster of radiation injuries. In this case, the
notification channel will involve the national IHR focal point and WHO, which
will promptly inform the IAEA, according to Article 6 of the IHR (2005) (27).
The timely identification of the cause of clusters or suspected outbreaks
associated with exposure to radiation may require a detailed investigation
involving clinical, epidemiological, environmental and laboratory analytical
approaches from multiple sectors/agencies.
Risk assessment in case of radiological and nuclear emergencies also involves
a multidisciplinary approach. Identification and assessment of exposure and
determining the radiation dose for affected individuals/populations will be
crucial for risk assessment.
What do we want to
achieve?
Comprehensive management of radiation emergencies requires prevention
and preparedness, early detection and effective response and recovery (23).
Prevention focuses on general measures that can be taken to diminish the
likelihood of a radiation emergency and to limit its severity.
Emergency planning and preparedness involve putting in place relevant
legislation, financing for a whole system of emergency preparedness and
response based on the protection strategy, putting in place operating procedures
and well-coordinated emergency response plans. In addition, adequate public
health preparedness involves designated health facilities to be equipped and
well-resourced and emergency response staff to be trained regularly.
Response deals with the various aspects of radiation emergencies (25),
including public health aspects of emergency sheltering and evacuation,
distribution of potassium iodide pills if needed (29), ensuring adequate risk
communication and management of the psychosocial impact of radiation
emergencies.
Recovery follows the transition period and includes evaluation of the lessons
learned of the past radiation emergencies, long-term follow up of the affected
persons, ensuring access to social, health care and welfare services, and
restoring the affected communities and environment and return to normality.

7. Climate change
 Overview
Climate change impacts health directly due to extreme weather events. Extreme heat, rising
sea levels, floods, extreme precipitation, droughts, and storms are increasingly frequent and
lead to tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in low- and middle-income countries (1).
Indirect effects of climate change result for example from food and water insecurity, increasing
transmission of vector- and water-borne diseases, the disruption of the health care system
and water and sanitation supplies, increased health inequality, and displacement/migration of
communities.
Main contributors to global climate change are fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes
but also agriculture, deforestation and other land-use changes, transportation and building
energy use (2). In addition, the health sector is a significant contributor to global carbon dioxide
emissions (2014 data) (3).
All people are exposed to the hazardous effects of climate change but some groups are
particularly vulnerable such as people living in small island nations and other coastal regions,
megacities, and mountainous and polar regions. Other vulnerable groups include children,
older people and those with underlying health conditions, especially those living in low-income
countries (4).
Actions in the area of climate change and health entail the following.
(a) Mitigate climate change, by reducing or preventing emissions of greenhouse gases; many of these actions
have co-benefits, for example they also reduce air pollution or save energy. Such co-benefits are already
listed in the respective sections of the compendium – Chapter 2 Air pollution and section Housing – the
most important ones are listed in this section as well.
(b) Adapt and increase resilience to climate change by increasing the ability to cope with the effects of climate
change, and respond in order to maintain essential functions; this is the main focus of this section.
Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment
98
How vulnerable is
population health to
climate change, and
what adaptation is
needed?
Perform a vulnerability and adaptation assessment to assess the most
vulnerable populations, identify weaknesses in the systems that should protect
them, and identify interventions to respond (5).
The steps in conducting such an assessment include (5) the following.
• Frame and scope the assessment.
• Analyse the risks of climate-sensitive health outcomes and the impact of
climate conditions.
• Analyse the capacity of health and other sectors to manage the risks of
those health outcomes.
• Estimate future health risks and impacts under climate change.
• Identify and prioritize policies and programmes to address future health
impacts.
• Identify resources for implementation, and estimate costs of action and
inaction.
Detailed guidance on how to conduct vulnerability and adaptation
assessments is available (5).
Climate change and health in Small Island Developing States (SIDS): SIDS are
uniquely vulnerable to climate change due to frequent exposure to extreme
weather and climate events, sea level rise, while also being constrained by
limited resources. WHO has therefore developed a special initiative on climate
change and health in SIDS (6). Though most of the guidance listed below
will apply to SIDS even more urgent action to adapt to climate change will be
needed in these countries, as they are they among the first countries being
adversely affected.

planning to address climate risks, establishment of institutional
mechanisms, capacities and roles and responsibilities to address
climate change impacts, and health protection from climate
change in legal and regulatory systems. Partnerships and crosssectoral cooperation are necessary for efficient regulatory, policy
and strategic implementation (8). Concrete examples of outputs
may include the following.
Governance
• Climate change and health focal points are designated within
the health ministry with specific programme of action and
budget allocated.
• Climate change and health focal points or units work

diseases, disaster risk reduction) to build resilience of
programmes.
Policy
• National strategy on health and climate change and/or health
component in national adaptation plans is developed.
Cross-sectoral collaboration
• Agreements (e.g. Memoranda of Understanding) are
established between the health ministry and main
stakeholders at the national level (e.g. meteorological
services, ministries of environment, food and agriculture,
energy, transport, planning, water, sanitation, infrastructure/
public works), which include specific roles and responsibilities
in relation to protecting health from climate change.
• Health representation is ensured in main climate change
processes at national, regional and global levels (e.g. the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) meetings and Conference of the Parties (COP),
national adaptation plan, national communications to the
UNFCCC).
• Main policies and strategies from health-determining
sectors reflect climate change and health considerations
both in relation to adaptation (e.g. climate-resilient WSPs)
and mitigation (e.g. health co-benefits in transport systems
including walking and cycling).
• Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) are conducted for new
mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes in all
health-determining sectors.

Drinking-water safety: adaptation and increased resilience
Water safety may be affected by i) more intense precipitation and flooding; ii) increased drought; iii) increased temperature; and iv) sea level rise. This can
lead to increased levels of waterborne pathogens and other harmful contaminants, increased vector breeding sites, floods, and water and food scarcity.
22. Develop a water safety plan (WSP) to systematically manage
all risks within a water supply system, from catchment to
consumer, which may impact public health, including climaterelated risks.
Note: This section describes only how climate considerations can
be integrated into the WSP approach. For general information on
WSPs, see section 3.2.1 Drinking-water.
The key actions of water safety planning for climate resilience
include the following.
• Augment the WSP team with relevant climate-related
expertise.
• Integrate relevant climate information into the water supply
system description.
• Identify climate-related hazards and assess the risks.
• Develop an incremental improvement plan to increase climate
resilience.
• Develop management procedures and supporting
programmes that strengthen the climate resilience of the
system (11).

Sanitation safety: adaptation and increased resilience
Similar to water safety, sanitation safety may be affected by i) more intense precipitation; ii) more variable or declining rainfall or run-off; iii) more frequent
or more intense storms or cyclones; iv) sea level rise; and v) more variable and increasing temperatures. This can lead to damaged infrastructure, flooding
of latrines and other sanitation systems causing faecal environmental contamination and bypassing of treatment processes, spillage and contamination,
higher pollution concentration in wastewater, increased deposits and blockages due to water scarcity (12, 13).

8. Nature and
health
8.1 Protection of
nature, biodiversity and
ecosystems for health
Many interventions that protect nature, biodiversity and ecosystems such as interventions for mitigating
climate change are not included here but in many of the other topics included in this compendium. Examples
include raising awareness about pollution abatement of recreational water bodies (section 3.2.2 Recreational
water), interventions for a sustainable healthy diet (section 10.2 Healthy diets and the environment) and
interventions for safe and sustainable mobility (section 9.2 Environments for safe and sustainable transport,
active mobility and physical activity).
 Overview
Human health and well-being depend on the natural environment, which is the source of clean
air, water, healthy soils and food. The natural environment comprises ecosystems, which when
healthy and thriving, also confer protection against climate change and disaster risk. Ecosystems
include for example forests, marine and freshwater ecosystems, grasslands and mountains
and comprise a range of different species that interact with each other and the surrounding
environment. The stability and health of ecosystems, however, depend on biodiversity.
Biodiversity has many more strong links to health; examples include the prevention of infectious
disease outbreaks and pandemics, nutritional diversity and food security, and the provision of
medicines. Ecosystems and biodiversity are directly threatened by human activities such as land
use change, overexploitation of resources, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species.
Reducing pressure on the natural environment, from deforestation to intensive and polluting
agricultural practices, to unsafe management and consumption of wildlife, will protect the
environment that humans rely on, for their health and ultimately their economy (1-3).
111
What is the situation
regarding the
protection of nature
and biodiversity in my
country?
The indicators of SDG 14 “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and
marine resources for sustainable development” and SDG 15 “Protect, restore
and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage
forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt
biodiversity loss” are directly relevant for assessing national efforts towards
greater protection of nature, ecosystems and biodiversity (4).
The majority of SDGs are directly or indirectly related to biodiversity.
Indicators for country assessment of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets (listed
below) have also been proposed (5, 6).
What do we want to
achieve?
The tenth meeting of the COP held in 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan,
adopted a revised and updated Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, including the
Aichi Biodiversity Targets, for the 2011–2020 period (7).
The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets (6) aim for:
1. increased awareness of the values of biodiversity
2. integration of biodiversity values into decision-making
3. elimination of incentives that are harmful to biodiversity
4. sustainable production and consumption
5. reduced loss of natural habitat
6. sustainable management of marine resources
7. sustainable agriculture, aquaculture and forestry
8. reduced pollution to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function
and biodiversity
9. prevention and control of invasive alien species
10. reduced anthropogenic pressures on vulnerable ecosystems
11. increased and improved protected areas
12. prevention of species extinction
13. maintaining and safeguarding genetic diversity
14. safeguarding ecosystems that provide essential services
15.restoring ecosystems and enhancing their resilience
16. implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources
and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization
17. adoption of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs)
18.respect for traditional knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous
and local communities
19. improved knowledge of biodiversity values, functions and trends, which is
shared and applied
20. increased financial resources for effectively implementing the Strategic
Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020.

8.2 Vector control
 Overview
Vector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are
transmitted by vectors. In most, but not all, cases the vector is a female mosquito in search of
a blood meal. Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and
cause more than 700 000 deaths annually (16). They comprise a range of diseases such as
malaria, dengue, Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis.
Diversity, composition and abundance of vector populations are closely linked to local climate
and ecosystems. Changes to environmental factors and systems such as through climate change
but also management and use of land, clearing of forests, mining and other extraction industries,
large-scale construction and development projects, urban and peri-urban development, water
resources and solid waste management may influence vector abundance and distribution (17).
The table below lists some major vectors and the diseases they transmit (16).
Vector-borne diseases are mainly prevented through vector control. Vector control includes both
chemical insecticide-based methods and non-chemical methods (see the following section on
integrated vector management).
Vector Disease(s)
Mosquitoes Malaria, dengue, lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, Mayaro virus
disease, yellow fever, Chikungunya, West Nile fever, Zika virus disease and
Rift Valley fever, Oropouche virus disease (mosquitoes and midges)

WHO response to vector control: integrated vector management
The WHO Global vector control response 2017–2030 (17) provides strategic guidance to countries
and development partners for urgent strengthening of vector control as a fundamental approach
to preventing disease and responding to outbreaks. It requires a re-alignment of vector control
programmes, supported by increased technical capacity, improved infrastructure, strengthened
monitoring and surveillance systems, and greater community mobilization.
The global vector control response builds on the basic concept of integrated vector management
(IVM) with renewed focus on improved human capacity at national and subnational levels and for
strengthened infrastructure and systems.
IVM, a rational decision-making process to optimize the use of resources for vector control,
was presented in 2004 in a WHO global strategic framework, and subsequently in other
supporting documents (18, 19). IVM is a management approach that improves the efficacy,
cost–effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustainability of vector control interventions with
available tools and resources. One of the key elements of an integrated approach to disease
vector control is the integration or combination of different, often chemical and non-chemical
vector control methods against multiple vector-borne diseases.
Chemical vector control methods include use of insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying,
outdoor spraying and other methods such as adding chemicals to water bodies and use of insect
repellents. Concerns with insecticide resistance and environmental toxicity have increased the
need for alternatives and, where feasible, more environmentally-sound approaches (20).
Non-chemical methods include biological and other methods and environmental management.
Biological methods include the utilization of natural enemies of the vector and biological toxoids.
Housing improvements can also facilitate vector control, although in many cases these also
deploy an insecticide, for example on insect screens (20).
Environmental management seeks to change the environment in order to prevent or minimize
vector propagation and human contact with the vector-pathogen by destroying, altering,
removing or recycling non-essential containers that provide larval habitats. It comprises the
planning, organization, carrying out and monitoring of activities for the modification and/
or manipulation of environmental factors or their interaction with humans for preventing or
minimizing vector propagation and reducing human-vector-pathogen contact (21).
Three types of environmental management exist.
1. Environmental modification – long lasting physical transformations to reduce vector larval
habitat.
2. Environmental manipulation – temporary changes to vector habitats.
3. Changes to human habitation or behaviours – actions to reduce human-vector contact.
It includes for example reduction of vector breeding habitats, use of PPE and housing
alterations (20, 22).
How prevalent are
vector-borne diseases in
my country?
National reporting systems may capture statistics on different vector-borne
diseases. As part of SDG Target 3.3 – by 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS,
tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis,
water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases – SDG 3 indicators
also monitor the occurrence of vector-borne diseases at national level:
• SDG indicator 3.3.3: Malaria incidence per 1,000 population
• SDG indicator 3.3.5: Number of people requiring interventions against
neglected tropical diseases.
In addition, the WHO Global Health Estimates provide a comprehensive and
comparable assessment of death and disability due to diseases and injuries for
all WHO Member States and all WHO regions of the world (23).

Malaria
The two core interventions for malaria vector control recommended by WHO are insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying.
One of these core interventions should be chosen and supplied to the entire population at risk for malaria. In specific settings, and under
special circumstances, these core interventions can be supplemented by larviciding (conditional recommendation) or other forms of
larval source management (no recommendation). As yet there is no evidence for the public health value for deployment of personal
protection measures such as repellents and clothing (conditional recommendation against deployment of topical repellents and
insecticide-treated clothing as interventions with public health value), however topical repellents and insecticide-treated clothing may
provide personal protection against malaria.
Due to limited evidence no recommendation is given on the non-chemical methods for malaria vector control listed below. They should
only be applied supplementary to (one of) the core interventions. Space spraying against malaria should be strongly discouraged given
the limited evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness and the potential for wastage of resources (23).
9. Support larval source management as supplementary
interventions for mosquito reduction.
Larval source management as a supplementary intervention
for malaria vector control includes environmental management
such as habitat modification and manipulation, larviciding and
biological controls.
In general and where feasible, environmental management
(habitat modification and manipulation) should be the primary
strategy to reduce the availability of larval habitats. However,
no systematic reviews have so far been conducted to inform the
development of WHO guidance in this area (23). This may include
the management of wetlands and drains and management of
irrigation (20).

10. Support housing improvements as potential additional

Available evidence indicates that poor-quality housing and
neglected peri-domestic environments are risk factors for
the transmission of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.
However, specific evidence-based recommendations on housing
and vector-borne diseases are still needed. The evidence base for
housing improvement as an approach for malaria prevention and
control is currently under review.

Dengue
Dengue mosquito control will reduce dengue, particularly when targeting Aedes aegypti in urban habitats, though a sustainable tool to
do so is lacking. Novel delivery methods have been developed to control Aedes vector populations using residual killing agents, including
targeted indoor residual spraying, which shows promise for reducing dengue. Adulticiding for dengue prevention is most effective
when it is conducted as part of an IVM plan that includes source reduction and larviciding. Successful dengue prevention programmes
include a combination of tools and strategies that are applied with enhanced intersectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation and strong
community engagement.
11. Implement environmental management (source reduction)
measures as the main pillar of dengue vector control (25).
Environmental management measures for dengue vector control
include the following.
• Environmental modification such as installation of reliable
piped water on premises.
• Environmental manipulation such as frequent emptying,
cleaning or mosquito-proof covering of water containers,
removal or filling of non-essential water containers, improved
solid waste management, and screening of construction sites,
open drains, and water bodies with stagnant water.
• Changes to human habitation and behaviour such as installing
mosquito screens on windows, doors and other entry points.
• Perifocal treatment of larval habitats and peripheral mosquito
resting surfaces or targeted residual spraying in homes and
other settings such as schools and workplaces as part of an
integrated dengue vector management programme.

environments
and mobility
9.1 Introduction
Sustainable transport and mobility systems in this section refer to systems that are multi-modal which
support walking, cycling, other forms of active transport and mobility (e.g. such as skating, wheelchairs),
as well as public transport in addition to private vehicles.
Interventions towards sustainable transport and mobility systems are aimed at reducing road traffic
fatalities and injuries while at the same time improving people’s health and well-being, protecting the
environment and address climate change. They often have broad impacts, and would therefore be
relevant for other sections of this compendium as well. 
Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment

9.2 Environments for safe
and sustainable transport,
active mobility and
physical activity
Comprehensive guidance on this topic beyond health and environment can be found elsewhere.10
 Overview
Systems of mobility that include public transport and infrastructure for cycling and walking can
contribute to increasing levels of physical activity. The positive health effects of regular physical
activity include improved muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness, improved bone and functional
health, reduced risk for NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes, and falls
and fractures and weight control (1). Regular physical activity also improves mental and cognitive
health and is recommended for people of all ages and abilities. Encouraging and enabling regular
physical activity requires adequate provision of, and equitable access to supportive environments
that encourage participation in walking, cycling, sports, active recreation and play by people of all
abilities (2, 3).
Transport can also affect health and health equity by enabling and facilitating access to
education, decent jobs, health care, leisure and clean water. Road infrastructure and urban
design can have an impact on social interaction within neighbourhoods while also discouraging
motorized transport and slowing the impact of climate change (4).
Road traffic accidents kill 1.3 million people per year (2019 data); pedestrians, cyclists and
motorcyclists in low- and middle-income countries are disproportionally affected (5, 6). More
cycling and walking tends to lead to fewer road traffic accidents as motorists become sensitized
to the presence of non-motorized traffic and to sharing the road (7). Increased road safety and
the provision of public and green spaces can enable and motivate people to walk and cycle more,
especially for short trips. Less motorized traffic also reduces air pollution, noise and carbon
emissions.
As the majority of the world population is living in urban areas, cities have a particular
responsibility and opportunity for improving urban design and transport systems to retain and
support increasing levels of walking and cycling. Affordable and accessible transport systems and
sustainable community infrastructure development are however equally relevant for peri-urban
and rural areas (4).

9. Safe environments and mobility
How do we assess
safe environments for,
and levels of, physical
activity in my country?
For country assessment of population levels of physical activity in adults, the
WHO STEPS approach includes the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire.
This collects data on physical activity undertaken across three domains in the
past week: for transport (which is defined as walking and cycling; at work (paid
and unpaid/around the home) and for recreation, leisure or sport. The Global
Physical Activity Questionnaire provides measures of the prevalence of walking
and cycling and time spent walking and cycling in the past week.
Countries may have their own similar health surveillance system with questions
on physical activity, however these do not always separate out a measure of
walking and cycling from total physical activity or may not include walking
and cycling for transport. For example, some countries assess “sports
participation” only.
For children there are school-based instruments that collect data on physical
activity, and these can also include questions on travel to/from school by
walking and cycling. The global school-based student health survey and
the health behaviour in school-aged children survey are two widely used
instruments and protocols.
Personal transportation surveys, usually conducted by ministries of transport
or similar agencies, can also collect data on walking and cycling trips. These
questions and data reporting vary between countries and there is no global
standardized reporting available yet. Nonetheless, usually data are presented
as the proportion of trips by mode that can be tracked over time and assessed
by setting (urban, rural) and by categories of trip length.
Urban design for safe walking and cycling can be assessed using the road
safety assessments and criteria set for roads achieving at least a 3 star rating
(of a 5-star maximum) (8) for each road user (i.e. for pedestrians, cyclists
and users of public transit). New roads and urban infrastructure can be
assessed during the development plan approval process. Both approaches are
recommended as part of the Decade of Action on Road Safety 2011–2020,
the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and the WHO ACTIVE
technical guidance toolkit to increase physical activity (2, 3).
At the global level, countries can monitor their progress towards key SDGs to
which active mobility and physical activity contribute (9). These include the
following.
SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
• Indicator 3.4.1: Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer,
diabetes or chronic respiratory disease.
• Indicator 3.6.1: Death rate due to road traffic injuries.
SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and
sustainable.
• Indicator 11.2.1: Proportion of population that has convenient access to
public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities.
• Indicator 11.7.1: Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open
space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities.
Other SDGs that are directly or indirectly transport-related include SDG 2 “End
hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable
agriculture”, SDG 7 “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
modern energy for all”, SDG 9 “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive
and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”, SDG 12 “Ensure
sustainable consumption and production patterns” and SDG 13 “Take urgent
action to combat climate change and its impacts”. In addition, SDG indicator
3.9.1 monitors air pollution.

What do we want to
achieve?
Shift more passenger and freight travel to more environmentally friendly
modes (e.g. walking, cycling and clean public and freight transport) together
with improvements in the energy efficiency of all motorized transport modes
(private and public) through low carbon fuel and vehicle technologies (10).
Reduce passenger trips and freight movement by motorized transport modes
through urban and regional development policies, integrated transport and
spatial planning and travel demand management (11, 12).
Investments in strengthening transport and mobility systems that take into
consideration underlying social and environmental determinants of health can
also help to ensure equitable access to mobility and reduce disparities. For
instance, improved mobility for women, children, older people and the poor
also enhances health equity (10), (11, 12), (7).
People of all ages and abilities need to have equitable access to safe and
appropriate places and spaces in their cities and communities in which they
can engage in regular physical activity. In addition, people need to know and
understand the multiple benefits of regular physical activity which can be
achieved through regular community-wide campaigns and education (2).
WHO recommends that all children and adolescents achieve at least 60
minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily. Adults should
do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or do at least
75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week. More
detailed recommendations on physical activity are provided in the Global
recommendations on physical activity for health (13).
Road traffic crashes and road injuries and fatalities can be reduced for
example through developing, implementing and enforcing a safe systems
approach which places the focus on the design of the system rather than on
road user behaviour. Special attention needs to be paid to how systems that
are poorly designed put road users such as walkers and cyclists in positions of
vulnerability and the ways in which they can be amended (14).

• Implement regulations to redistribute the impact of motorized
vehicles such as car-free zones, identify hazardous road
locations and take corrective measures accordingly.
These engineering interventions need to be accompanied by
education and enforcement of for example traffic laws and vehicle
safety standards.

9.3.1 Drownings
 Overview
Drowning is a leading cause of unintentional injury and deaths worldwide and about 90% of
unintentional drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (6, 23). In 2019, an
estimated 236 000 people died from drowning, making drowning a major public health problem
worldwide (6). Children are at increased risk of drowning and 35% of drowning deaths occurred in
children aged under 15 years.
How prevalent are
drownings in my
country?
National reporting systems may capture statistics on drownings and other
injuries.
Injury surveillance guidelines are available to assess data on injuries (24).
In addition, the WHO Global Health Estimates provide a comprehensive and
comparable assessment of death and disability due to diseases and injuries for
all WHO Member States and all WHO regions of the world (25).

appropriate travel routes and rules;
• laws on alcohol and drug use while boating or swimming;
• occupational safety measures, such as the wearing of
personal flotation devices and guard-rails, for example on
commercial fishing vessels.
Other water safety policies may include signage and barriers
for high-risk locations, risk assessments for recreational water
settings (see section 3.2.2 Recreational water) and water safety
lessons for schools.

9.3.2 Falls
 Overview
Falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury or deaths worldwide. Each
year an estimated 684 000 individuals die from falls globally, the majority of which occur in lowand middle-income countries (6) (2019 data). Environmental risk factors for falls include aspects
of the built environment such as poor building design, slippery floors and stairs and insufficient
lighting (28).
How prevalent are falls
in my country?
National reporting systems may capture statistics on falls and other injuries.
Injury surveillance guidelines are available to assess data on injuries (24).
In addition, the WHO Global Health Estimates provide a comprehensive and
comparable assessment of death and disability due to diseases and injuries for
all WHO Member States and all WHO regions of the world (25).
While all people who fall are at risk of injury, the age, sex and health of the
individual can affect the type and severity of injury. Children and adults older
than 65 years of age are among the high-risk groups, while the latter have the
highest risk of death or serious injury arising from a fall, with the risk increasing
with age (28).

9.3.3 Burns
 Overview
An estimated 114 000 deaths every year are caused by burns (6) (2019 data), the vast majority of
which occur in low- and middle-income countries. Non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of
morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, disfigurement and disability, often with resulting
stigma and rejection (32).
Burns are preventable and occur mainly in the home and workplace. Women and children are
particularly vulnerable to burns, with burns being the fifth most common cause of non-fatal
childhood injuries (32). Furthermore, burn victims are often among the poorest and most
vulnerable population groups, especially in low- and middle-income countries (33).
How prevalent are burns
in my country?
National reporting systems may capture statistics on burns and other injuries.
Injury surveillance guidelines are available to assess data on injuries (24).

10.1 Food safety and
the environment
A safe food supply contributes to food and nutrition security and supports national economies, trade and
tourism, stimulating sustainable development (1). This includes proper food preparation, which can prevent a
large share of foodborne diseases. Different governmental departments and agencies, encompassing public
health, agriculture, education and trade, need to collaborate and communicate with each other and engage
with civil society, including consumer groups, to ensure a safe food supply.
This section only covers aspects of food safety related to the environment, such as household and
community hygiene practices and the use of wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture.
Comprehensive guidance on this topic beyond health and environment can be found elsewhere.12
 Overview
Access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food is key to sustaining life and promoting
good health. Safe food is not contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria, parasites,
viruses, toxins, chemicals and/or radionuclides. However, food can become contaminated at
any point of production and distribution. A large proportion of foodborne disease incidents are
caused by foods improperly or unhygienically prepared or mishandled at home, in food service
establishments or markets.

Use of wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture/aquaculture: policies and actions
5. Develop or update national standards and regulation for the
safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture and
aquaculture in line with the WHO guidelines (4).
This includes the setting of health-based targets that define a
level of health protection relevant to each hazard.
For setting and achieving the health-based targets the following
steps are important.
• Routinely assess health risks associated with the use
of wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture or
aquaculture, for example through microbial and chemical
laboratory analysis, epidemiological studies and quantitative
microbial (and chemical) risk assessment.
• Identify health protection measures (covered below).
• Monitor and assess the system (covered below).
Note: The WHO guidelines generally apply to the use of domestic
wastewater. Industrial wastewater usually poses greater risks,
which may require different precautions and measures (4).

Often a combination of measures will be needed. Examples of key
measures and messages include the following.
For the protection of consumers
• Treat wastewater and excreta used in agriculture/aquaculture.
• Use lower quality effluents to irrigate non-vegetable crops or
those that are not eaten uncooked (crop restriction).
• Apply wastewater application techniques that minimize
contamination (e.g. drip irrigation).
• Allow pathogen die-off after the last wastewater application.
For the protection of workers and their families
• Treat wastewater and excreta used in agriculture/aquaculture.
• Use PPE during handling.
• Provide access to safe drinking-water and sanitation facilities.
• Implement disease vector and intermediate host control.
• Reduce vector contact.
For the protection of local communities
• Treat wastewater and excreta used in agriculture/aquaculture.
• Restrict access to irrigated fields, hydraulic structures and
aquacultural facilities.
• Provide access to safe recreational water, especially for
adolescents.
• Provide access to safe drinking-water and sanitation facilities.
• Implement disease vector and intermediate host control.
• Reduce vector contact.

The most effective means of consistently ensuring safety in
wastewater, excreta or greywater use in agriculture or aquaculture
is through the use of a comprehensive risk assessment and
risk management approach that encompasses all steps in the
process, from the generation and use of wastewater, excreta or
greywater to product consumption.
System assessment aims to establish a comprehensive
understanding of the system, the range and magnitude of
hazards, the magnitude of risk levels and the ability of existing
processes and infrastructure to manage actual or potential risks.

10.2 Healthy diets and
the environment
Comprehensive guidance on this topic beyond health and environment can be found elsewhere.13
 Overview
Access, intake and uptake to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food is key to sustaining life
and promoting good health (1). A healthy diet protects against malnutrition as well as NCDs such
as diabetes, IHD, stroke and cancer (7).
With regard to health, much of the food that is consumed contains too little whole plant foods
(fruits and vegetables) and too much added sugars and salt, saturated fats and trans-fatty acids.
Shifting to more healthy diets would reduce a great disease burden mainly from NCDs (6, 8).
With regard to the environment, current patterns of food production and consumption use much
of the world’s resources on land and water and contribute significantly to climate and ecosystem
change through for example deforestation, loss of biodiversity and GHG emissions (9). This is
aggravated by the fact that about one third of food produced for human consumption is wasted (10).
Which diets are
sustainable and
healthy?
Sustainable healthy diets are diets that promote individuals’ health and
well-being and have low environmental impact. They are based on a great
variety of plant-based, and unprocessed or minimally processed foods. These
foods must be made available, accessible, affordable, safe and desirable to
the whole population including the most vulnerable (11). They need to be
accessible, affordable, safe and culturally acceptable.
SDG 2 “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture” includes the following selected targets (12).
• Target 2.1: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in
particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to
safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.
• Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by
2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children
under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls,
pregnant and lactating women and older persons.
• Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and
implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and
production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for
adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and
other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.
• Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated
plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species,
including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at
the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and
fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic
resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.

11. Environmental noise
2022 update
11. Environmental noise
This section addresses exposure of the general population to environmental noise, such as noise from various
forms of traffic or industry. It includes amplified music in the framework of leisure activities as well. It does
not specifically include occupational noise exposure. Occupational risks, including noise exposure, are
covered in section 11.3 on workplaces.
 Overview
In 2011, an estimated one million healthy life years were lost from traffic-related noise in the western
part of Europe only (1). Important sources for environmental noise exposure are road, railway and air
traffic, or building sites. Noise exposure can also occur through other sources such as wind turbines,
and leisure activities such as listening to loud music or other audio content including participation in
e-sports (video and computer game competitions). Excessive noise can cause annoyance; in addition
research shows it increases the risk for IHD and hypertension, sleep disturbance, hearing impairment,
tinnitus and cognitive impairment, with increasing evidence for other health impacts such as adverse
birth outcomes and mental health problems (2).
What is the proportion
of people impacted by
environmental noise in
my country?
The noise indicators below are taken from guidelines that were developed
for the WHO European Region. In terms of their health implications, the
recommended exposure levels can be considered applicable in other regions
and suitable for a global audience (2).
Noise indicators are based on the European Union Directive 2002/49/EC (3) in
the European Region.
• L den is an average sound pressure level over all days, evenings and nights in
a year.
• L night is the equivalent continuous sound pressure level when the reference
time interval is the night.
• LAeq, T is the A-weighted (a frequency weighting to better reflect the human
ear), equivalent continuous sound pressure level during a stated time
interval starting at t1 and ending at t2, expressed in decibels (dB), at a given
point in space.
The first two indicators are used particularly for noise monitoring and exposure
assessment. The third is used for measuring leisure noise exposure. For more
information on these and other noise indicators consult the Environmental
noise guidelines for the European Region (2). These noise indicators can be
converted to other indicators used in other settings (4).
What is the proportion
of people impacted by
environmental noise in
my country?
Several countries use surveys to assess the perception of noise in the general
population. The last European Quality of Life survey, carried out 2016–2017,
found that 32% of more than 30 000 participants across Europe reported
problems with noise in the immediate neighbourhood of their home (5). 
Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment
150 2022 update
What are the levels of
noise exposure we want
to achieve?
Based on the systematic review of evidence available at the time of the
development of the environmental noise guidelines (2), the following
recommended levels for specific noise sources can be defined.
For average noise exposure, the following sound pressure levels are
recommended (2, 6):
• < 53 dB Lden for road traffic noise
• < 54 dB Lden for railway noise
• < 45 dB Lden for aircraft noise
• < 45 dB Lden for wind turbine noise
• yearly average from all leisure source noises combined to ≤ 70 dB LAeq, 24h
• weekly average from leisure sources (such as personal listening devices 14)
≤ 80 dB(A) or 1.6 Pa2h
• short-term average from occasional exposure to leisure source noise ≤ 100
dB LAeq, 15min.
For night noise exposure, the following sound pressure levels are
recommended (2):
• < 45 dB Lnight for road traffic noise
• < 44 dB Lnight for railway noise
• < 40 dB Lnight for aircraft noise.
Different categories of noise mitigation interventions along a continuum from
source reduction to behaviour change can be defined. Interventions in the
guidance section below are marked with A–E as defined hereafter (2).
A. Source intervention:
• change in emission levels of sources
• time restrictions on source operators.
B. Path intervention:
• change in the path between source and receiver
• path control through insulation of receiver/receiver’s dwelling
C. New/closed infrastructure:
• opening of a new infrastructure noise source
• closure of an existing one
• planning controls between (new) receivers and sources.
D. Other physical intervention:
• change in other physical dimensions of dwelling/neighbourhood.
E. Behaviour change intervention:
• change in individual behaviour to reduce exposure
• avoidance of exposure or reduced duration of exposure
• community education and communication.

12.1 Cities and other urban
settlements
Cities and other urban settlements can bring many opportunities for better health, a cleaner environment
and climate action. Strong urban policies must match those goals since health is essential for fostering good
urban livelihoods, building a productive workforce, creating resilient and vibrant communities, enabling
physical mobility, promoting social interaction and protecting vulnerable populations.
This section addresses the main principles and areas for actions to better integrate health in the built
environment and spatial planning decisions in cities. The agenda for mutual and cross-cutting support
between the built environment, planning and health is very long. It encompasses multiple levels (e.g. local,
regional), numerous stakeholders and many sectors (e.g. transport, housing, land-use).
Cities and other urban settlements should also make use of the opportunity presented by having a
single authority under a city mayor who is empowered to take cross-sectoral decisions, for example on
urban planning, transportation systems, purchasing, supply of energy, water and sanitation and waste
management. Strategic urban planning will be the key to creating supportive and enabling environments for
health, making sure that health and equity considerations are integrated throughout the planning process,
investment period, and policy decisions made at the local level.
Comprehensive guidance on this topic beyond health and environment can be found elsewhere.15
 Overview
Urbanization is one of the leading global trends of the 21st century that has a significant impact
on health. Over 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to
increase to 68% by 2050 (1). As most future urban growth will take place in developing cities, this
provides policy-makers with a unique opportunity to guide urbanization and other major urban
development trends in a way that protects and promotes health.

12.2 Housing
Improved housing conditions can save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty and
help mitigate climate change. Housing is becoming increasingly important to health in light of urban growth,
ageing populations and climate change.
This section addresses the main principles and areas for action to improve housing conditions and provide
healthy and sustainable housing for all. Multiple co-benefits for health, the environment and social equality
arise from addressing the key health risks associated with housing. For example, installing adequate thermal
insulation and energy efficient heating can improve indoor temperatures that support health, while also
lowering expenditure on energy and reducing carbon emissions.
Successful implementation of housing improvements requires the government to work together across the
local, regional and national level as well as across different sectors including health, housing and energy. As
many interventions need to be realized by homeowners and through the support of the private sector, civil
society engagement and collaboration with implementing actors – such as housing managers, architects,
urban planners, social housing services, consumer protecting agencies, and the building industry – is crucial.
 Overview
According to UN-Habitat estimates, about 3 billion people – or 40% of the world’s population –
will need access to adequate housing by 2030 (14). This creates a need for 96 000 new, affordable
and accessible housing units every day. Access to safe and healthy housing is a human right and
one mechanism through which social and economic inequalities translate into health inequality.

12.3 Workplaces
 Overview
More than 1.2 million deaths annually (2015 data) are estimated to be caused by occupational
risks (27). Large gaps persist with regard to the health status of workers and their exposure
to occupational risks. In addition, only a small minority of the global workforce has access to
occupational health services. Nevertheless, effective interventions to prevent occupational
hazards and to protect and promote health at the workplace are available (28).
Assessment of national
occupational health
and safety
Workers’ health is determined not only by workplace hazards but also by social
and individual factors and access to health services (28).
The following SDG indicators are important for national assessment and
monitoring of occupational health and safety.
• Indicator 8.8.1: Fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000
workers, by sex and migrant status.
• Indicator 8.8.2: Level of national compliance with labour rights (freedom
of association and collective bargaining) based on ILO textual sources and
national legislation, by sex and migrant status.
• Indicator 1.3.1: Proportion of population covered by social protection
floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older
persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury
victims and the poor and the vulnerable.
In addition, there are SDG targets for monitoring the proportion of informal
employment, average hourly earnings, unemployment rates, proportion of
youth not in education, employment or training and proportion and number of
children aged 5–17 years engaged in hazardous child labour.
Workplaces with a high risk for work-related disease and injury include mining,
construction, agriculture and manufacturing. Other occupational groups, such
as office- or health care workers, are at risk of specific health conditions such
as stress and musculoskeletal diseases or overexertion and infections (27).
Special attention needs to be paid to the approximately 2 billion people (61% of
the world’s employed population) working in the informal economy. The informal
economy involves vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, older
persons and migrant workers. Informal work has usually harmful effects on
workers’ rights, social protection and working conditions, thus placing informal
workers at greater risk of work-related deaths and disease (29).

What is the level of
occupational health
and safety we want to
achieve?
SDG 8 focuses on sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full
and productive employment and decent work for all (30). Relevant targets
include the following.
• Target 8.3: Promote development-oriented policies that support productive
activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation,
and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and mediumsized enterprises, including through access to financial services.
• Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent
work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with
disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.
• Target 8.6: By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in
employment, education or training.
• Target 8.7: Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced
labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition
and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and
use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.
• Target 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working
environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women
migrants, and those in precarious employment.
The WHO Global Plan of Action on Workers’ Health 2008–2017 (28) underlines
the importance of:
• all workers being able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical
and mental health;
• favourable working conditions for all workers;
• the workplace not threatening health and well-being;
• primary prevention of occupational health hazards;
• all components of health systems to be involved in an integrated response to
the specific health needs of working populations.

16. Establish occupational health policies and programmes in all
health care facilities (35, 36).
The WHO-ILO Global Framework for National Occupational Health
Programmes for Health Workers includes the following building
blocks.
• Identify a responsible person with authority for occupational
health at both the national and workplace levels.
• Develop a written policy on safety, health and working
conditions for health workforce protection at the national and
workplace levels.
• Ensure access to occupational health services by
strengthening the existing, or establishing a new, occupational
health programme, and allocate sufficient resources/budget
to the programme, occupational health professional services
and the procurement of necessary PPE and supplies.
• Create joint labour-management health and safety
committees, with appropriate worker and management
representation.
• Provide ongoing (or periodic) education and training that
is appropriate to all parties, including occupational health
practitioners, senior executives, front-line managers,
health and safety committees, front-line workers and their
representatives, and the general public.
• Identify hazards and hazardous working conditions in order to
prevent and control them, and manage risks by applying the
occupational health hierarchy of controls, which prioritizes
elimination or control at the source.
• Provide pre-service and ongoing immunization against
hepatitis B and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the
workplace at no cost to the employee (this includes all three
doses of the hepatitis B vaccine for all workers at risk of blood
exposure, including cleaners and waste handlers).
• Promote exposure and incident reporting, eliminating barriers
to reporting and providing a blame-free environment.
• Promote and ensure health worker access to diagnosis,
treatment, care and support for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and
viral hepatitis B and C.
• Utilize appropriate information systems to assist in the
collection, tracking, analysing, reporting and acting upon data
to promote health and safety of the health care workplace and
health workforce.
• Ensure that health workers are entitled to compensation for
work-related disability in accordance with national laws.

12.4 Health care facilities
There are a considerable number of co-benefits to health of environmentally responsible practices such
as climate change mitigation measures; examples may include use of natural ventilation, capture and use
of rainwater, improved recapture and reuse of anaesthetic gases, and well-designed telehealth schemes.
Environmentally responsible practices can also increase health equity and access to health care such as
the siting of health care facilities along major public transport routes and the development of low-energy or
no-energy medical devices (60).
Recommendations listed in the guidance tables in many other sections are relevant for health care and
health care facilities, and are not usually repeated here. They can be found in the guidance tables under the
rubric “health” and “health care” of the columns showing the sector involved and level of implementation,
respectively.
Comprehensive guidance on this topic beyond health and environment can be found elsewhere.16
 Overview
Access to reliable and sustainable energy is a prerequisite for high-quality health care. Safely
managed water, sanitation, access to basic hygiene facilities and adequate waste management
are needed to maintain hygienic environments and prevent health care-acquired infections.
Occupational health services need to protect health care workers in order to ensure health care
delivery. Furthermore, the health sector can adopt a wide range of environmentally responsible
practices when offering its health care and prevention services, and help protect and promote
health through those practices (60).
Yet as many as 1 in 4 health care facilities lack access to even basic levels of water, exposing
1.8 billion people to greater risk of infections. In addition, 1 in 3 health care facilities lack
hand hygiene at points of care, 1 in 3 do not segregate waste safely and 1 in 10 have no
sanitation services (based on a 2020 global update from WHO/UNICEF which includes data for
165 countries) (61).

Note: Sufficient water relates to minimum water quantities
required in the health care setting. Set figures are available for
planning and designing water supply systems. Actual figures of
water quantities required depend on a number of factors, such as
size of facility, services offered and number of patients accessing
services, climate, level of care and local water use practices.

examples may include the following.
• A drinking-water station with safe17 drinking-water available
and accessible for staff, patients and carers at all times and
in main waiting areas and/or entrances to each ward and in
all rooms where patients stay overnight or receive specialized
care.
• Functioning hand hygiene stations (water and soap or alcoholbased hand rub) are available at all points of care and service
areas.
• Hand-washing facilities (water and soap) within 5 metres of

6. Ensure rapid and safe wastewater disposal (62, 66). Concrete
examples may include the following.
• Wastewater is conveyed safely away from the facility to
treatment with minimal leaks/overflows.
• Wastewater drainage is built and managed to avoid
contamination of the health care setting or the broader
environment.
• A stormwater (i.e. rainwater) and greywater drainage system
is in place that diverts water away from the facility into a safe
drainage or leach field and does not carry contamination
from the health care setting to the outside surrounding
environment.
• Hazardous chemical waste and pharmaceuticals are not
discharged into wastewater.

7. Implement an IPC programme (37). The basic set of IPC
guidelines should include as a minimum:
• standard precautions;
• hand hygiene;
• use of PPE;
• sterilization and medical devices decontamination;
• safe handling of linen and laundry;
• health care waste management;
• patient placement;
• respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette;
• environmental cleaning;
• principles of asepsis;
• prevention of injuries from sharp instruments and postexposure prophylaxis;
• transmission-based precautions;
• aseptic technique and device management for clinical
procedures, according to the scope of care.
Since the scope of practices may be very different in health care
facilities according to the type of care offered, the guidelines
should prioritize the most frequent and/or risky practices and
settings.

9. Consider as much as possible options for waste minimization,
environmentally preferable purchasing and green procurement,
and safe reuse, recycling and recovery (68). Concrete examples
may include the following.
• Ensure all staff practise appropriate waste segregation at all
points of care using a three-bin system.
• Raise awareness about and train medical staff in clinical
and general practices to use or waste fewer materials, with
techniques such as the “first in, first out” principle (what has
been purchased first, should also be used first).
• Choose approaches to ordering supplies that generate less
waste, such as more frequent ordering of relatively small
quantities, particularly for unstable products, and selecting
products that produce less or less hazardous waste.
• Use physical rather than chemical cleaning methods (e.g.
steam disinfection).
• Purchase hazardous chemicals centrally and monitor their use.
• Procure equipment made from plastics that can be more
easily recycled (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene and
polyethylene terephthalate instead of polyvinyl chloride or
mixed materials such as paper covered in plastics).
• Implement an environmental management system.

10. Ensure safe segregation, collection, transportation, storage,
treatment and disposal of health care waste (62, 66). Concrete
examples may include the following.
• Trained waste handlers are available and have sufficient PPE
to carry out their duties safely.
• Waste segregation should be nationally standardized, should
rely on a uniform colour coding or labelling system and should
at the least segregate general waste from sharps waste and
(other) infectious waste.
• General waste and infectious or hazardous waste should be
collected, transported and stored separately.
• Collection and internal transportation should happen at
fixed times and fixed waste routes from the most to the least
hygienically sensitive area.
• Internal waste storage locations must be totally enclosed
and well separated from other areas; the storage location for
infectious and sharps waste must be clearly identifiable with
floors and walls sealed or tiled. External waste storage should
be fenced as a minimum. Only authorized staff should have
access to the waste storage areas. Maximum storage times for
infectious waste, which are temperature dependent, need to
be considered.
• In general, health-care waste should be treated using a
technique which minimizes the formation and release of
chemicals or hazardous emissions. Infectious and sharps
waste should generally be treated by steam or other non-burn
technologies where these options are locally available and
sustainable.
• Final disposal should happen in designated places outside
the premises of the health care facility. A functional burial pit/
fenced waste dump or municipal pick-up should be available
for disposal of non-infectious (non-hazardous/general) waste
and waste disposal areas should be built to withstand climateevents and emergencies.
• Pharmaceutical waste should be treated and disposed of
safely by one of the following options: at a centrally managed
safe treatment & disposal facility (i.e. off-site)/sent back to
the manufacturer/co-incinerated by industries using hightemperature kilns.

 Overview
Children are exposed to many different environments that have a profound influence on their
growth and development. Environmental exposures, both adverse and health-promoting, do
not work in isolation but interact with social and nutritional determinants of health to influence
children’s health and well-being. Adverse environmental exposures include among others
polluted indoor and outdoor air, contaminated water, lack of adequate sanitation, household and
community environmental hazards, toxic hazards, disease vectors, UV radiation and degraded
ecosystems (1, 2).
Children are especially vulnerable to environmental threats due to their developing organs and
immune systems, smaller bodies and airways. Proportionate to their size, children ingest more
food, drink more water and breathe more air than adults. In addition, certain modes of behaviour,
such as putting hands and objects into the mouth and playing outdoors can increase children’s
exposure to environmental contaminants. Furthermore, children as young as five years old
sometimes work in hazardous settings (2, 3).
Health-damaging exposure to environmental risks often begins before birth. Lead in air, mercury
in food and other chemicals can result in long-term, often irreversible, effects such as infertility,
miscarriage and birth defects. Women's exposure to pesticides, solvents and persistent organic
pollutants may potentially affect the health of the fetus. In addition, while the overall benefits of
breastfeeding are recognized, high levels of contaminants in breast milk may affect the health of the
newborn. Health impacts resulting from exposures at young ages may only emerge later in life (2).
An estimated 1.6 million deaths in children aged under 5 years in 2016 were due to environmental
risks, which means 28% of all deaths in children that year could have been prevented through a
cleaner and safer environment. Especially in low-income countries, environmental health risks
are important contributors to childhood death and disease (4). More than 90% of children breathe
toxic air every day (5). Up to 800 million children (or around 1 in 3) have blood lead levels at or
above 5 µg/dl (6). Improving children’s environmental health presents an essential contribution
towards the achievement of the SDGs.

13.2 Health in All Policies
 Overview
HiAP is a framework for action with the aim of collaborating across sectors to systematically
consider health in policy-making. It is an approach to public policy that considers the health
implications of decisions, seeks synergies and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve
population health and health equity (9, 10).
Many risks to health are influenced or even determined by policies in sectors other than the
health sector. Examples are transitions in energy and transport that have multiple health cobenefits for environmental protection. Other key sectors responsible for policies that offer win-win
situations for health and the environment include WASH, agriculture and food items, land use
planning, labour, housing, industry and the energy sector.
The health sector needs a policy mandate, space and competencies to work with other sectors
to understand their constraints and interests, and to identify challenges and opportunities to
include the health and co-benefit argument in relevant policies. In addition, the health sector
needs to increase its efforts to engage with other sectors to promote health protection, ensure
essential environmental services and healthy workplaces, and work towards making the health
sector more environmentally sustainable (10, 11). The WHO HiAP manual provides some
information on needed skills and competencies (12).

13.3 Health Impact
Assessment
 Overview
The Health Impact Assessment (HIA) uses a combination of procedures, methods and tools by
which a policy, programme or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a
population, and the distribution of those effects within the population. The HIA involves working
with a range of decision-makers and stakeholders to support the building of healthy public policy.
It uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to describe the expected health impacts. It can
be included in environmental impact assessments, strategic environmental assessments, social
impact assessments or integrated impact assessments (13, 14).
Policy decisions made outside of the health sector influence many determinants of health.
The HIA evaluates the likely positive and negative health impacts from proposed policies,
programmes or projects from different sectors and makes recommendations on how to improve
health. It is typically a prospective assessment before implementation, although it may be carried
out concurrently or retrospectively.
The HIA includes the following steps.
• Screening – determine whether an HIA is required by determining potential health
implications of a policy, programme or project.
• Scoping – identify key health issues and public concerns to be covered in the assessment.
Potential health determinants may include factors such as the social and physical
environment (i.e. housing quality, crime rates and social networks), personal or family
circumstances (i.e. diet, exercise, risk-taking behaviour and employment) and access to
public services.
• Appraisal – estimate potential health gains or losses, including assessment of population
groups affected, baseline health status and predictions about likely changes of health status
through the programme, policy or intervention and from possible strategies to prevent
negative health impacts.
• Reporting – draw conclusions and make recommendations.
• Monitoring – monitor the actual health impacts.

WHO’s health advice for protecting nature, the environment
and our climate
People need a healthy environment in which to live. The planet we live on is under pressure. Too many
resources are being taken from the planet. These actions and pollution lead to climate change. They also
destroy nature. There are some actions you can take to protect nature and reduce pollution.
• Eat food grown locally. Such as vegetables, fruits, nuts and grains.
• Choose to cycle, walk and use public transport rather than drive a car or motorbike.
• Build houses that are good for your health. Such houses have insulation, so that it gets less hot or less
cold. They have ventilation, so that the air gets changed, and they have heating where necessary. They
should also protect against mosquitoes and other dangerous insects and animals.
• Use clean energy, and safe and energy saving devices, to cook and to light and to heat the home. Clean
energy comes for example from the sun or wind. It does not come from burning of fossil fuels, such as
coal.
• Avoid the use of pesticides and herbicides.
• Avoid using plastics only once. Examples are plastic bags and food packaging.

WHO’s health advice on breathing clean air
Most people breathe air that is harmful to their health. Air becomes polluted in many ways. Pollution can
come from cars and other vehicles. It can come from fires, factories, and by burning waste. Cooking on open
fires and unsafe cook-stoves creates smoke. This smoke can make people sick as well. There are some
actions you can take to reduce air pollution.

WHO’s health advice on the safe handling of chemicals
People get in contact with many different chemicals every day. Examples are products used to clean, bleach,
or disinfect, such as in the home or workplace. Many chemicals are harmless or even good for you. Others
such as pesticides are dangerous and can harm your health. There are some actions you can take to handle
chemicals safely.
• Store chemicals and medicines in a safe way. Safe storage means children cannot reach them or open
them.

WHO’s health advice on protecting yourself from radon
Radon is a radioactive gas that comes out of the ground. It may be found in high concentrations in buildings,
such as homes and workplaces. High concentrations of radon are mainly found on the lower floors of a
building. For example, it can be found on the ground floor or below, but it can also be found on upper levels.
Radon can be dangerous for your health and is one of the leading causes of lung cancer. There are actions
you can take to protect yourself from radon.
• Measure the radon level in your home, which is easy and cheap by using radon detectors.
Depending on the country, people can get a radon detector from a radon testing service. Or they can
check with their local government for radon detectors. People can also check with the national agency
in charge of radiation safety.
• Ask a radon expert or consultant how to reduce radon in your home. Or how to prevent radon when
building a new home.
