This training module has three parts:
• first, magnitude of the problem is a general overview, and sets the stage by discussing major trends in human
activities and their broad impact on the global environment and on human health;
• the next section, climate change and child health effects, concentrates on climate change as one of most
significant health threats facing children; and
• the final section, critical role of the health sector in protecting child health, discusses actions that must be taken
across many levels, from international to the individual. These actions are essential to protecting children’s
health in a world where the climate has already changed, and will continue to do so in the future.

In mid-September 2021, prior to the United NaXons Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, 233
internaXonal Xtles, including the most presXgious of medical and public health journals, simultaneously published
this editorial to the world:
“The science is unequivocal: a global increase of 1.5° C above the pre-industrial average and the conXnued loss of
biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse... ReflecXng the severity of the
moment, this editorial appears in health journals across the world. We are united in recognizing that only
fundamental and equitable changes to socieXes will reverse our current trajectory. The greatest threat to global
public health is the conXnued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5° C and to
restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world. We, as
editors of health journals, call for governments and other leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world
finally changes course (1).”

CLIMATE CHANGE
MAGNITUDE
OF THE PROBLEM
Climate change is a reality. This reality is beyond confusion or equivocation. The earth is warmer, the sea level is
rising, ice is melting and there is abundant direct evidence of these facts. Data from the past three decades prove
that the earth is warmer and weather patterns are more extreme and less predictable now than in pre-industrial
times. The graphs on this slide show trends in measures of climate change over time. On the top left, changes in
global surface temperature are shown from 1880 to 2021. The average global surface temperature has increased by
1.1 degrees Celsius (°C) since the late 19th century. The majority of global warming has happened in the past 35
years. At the time of the creation of these graphs, the two warmest years on record (2016 and 2020) both occurred
in the past decade (1).
The graphs on the right show ice loss at sea (top right) and on land (bottom right). The top right graph shows
average Arctic sea ice in million square kilometres (km) from 1979 to 2021 during the month of September. Arctic
sea ice is measured in September when it reaches its annual minimum. Artic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13% per
decade relative to the average during the period between 1981 and 2010. In Greenland, ice mass has been
decreasing since 2002. Most ice loss has occurred since 2009. In total, Greenland has lost 275 million metric tonnes
of ice since 2002. The bottom right graph shows the size of Greenland’s ice mass in gigatons (Gt) from 2002 to 2021
(1).
As ice melts, sea levels rise. The graph on the bottom left charts sea level change between 1993 and 2021. Sea level
has risen about 20 centimetres (cm) over the last century. The rate of sea level rise has almost doubled in the past
20 years (1).
Note: This module does not detail the science of these facts, nor does it detail the many lines of evidence which
document it. Those who are interested in learning more can find many available resources online including National
Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) global climate change website (1), the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) (2) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) (3).

Human influence on the climate is virtually certain. The strong consensus of global experts on climate and earth
sciences agree that humans are, and have been for decades, the major driver of today’s global warming, rising sea
level, ocean acidification and changing weather patterns. Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, along with
agriculture and industrial activities that produce greenhouse gases, have rapidly changed the atmosphere, increased
Earth’s “thermal blanket” and warmed the air and the oceans (1).
The graph on the slide shows the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere over hundreds of
thousands of years. It dramatically demonstrates the extraordinary increase in atmospheric CO2 since the midtwentieth century. CO2, which is the main anthropogenic (influenced by human activity) greenhouse gas, has a long
residence time and is anticipated to remain in the atmosphere for at least 500–1000 years. Data recorded in April
2022 show CO2 levels at 417 parts per million (ppm) compared to 280 ppm in preindustrial times (2). The high level
of CO2 in the atmosphere is now a reality and has significant health consequences for humans and many other
species on the planet.

OF THE PROBLEM
This complicated slide represents a summary of health effects from climate change. It also shows the potenXal for
risk reducXon through adaptaXon measures. These figures were developed from research literature and judgments
of health experts with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (1).
The width of each slice represents the relaXve proporXon or burden of disease at the populaXon level in each
category. The rings represent risk levels:
• the secXons in red indicate risks that can be improved be intensive adapXon efforts;
• the secXons in yellow represent risks that cannot be changed by intensive adapXon efforts.
In the top leu is the IPCC’s assessment of climate change and health effects in 2014 (“present”). The next two polar
plots are based on projected global warming unXl 2100. The key point is that as the world progressively warms, the
capaciXes of humans and ecosystems to adapt are reduced. Consequently, concurrent miXgaXon and adaptaXon
strategies are crucial for the survival, health and welfare of future generaXons.
As will be made clear by the end of this presentaXon; the current global condiXons are now closer to the second
polar plot (+1.5oC rise), than the one designated as “present” in 2014 (2).

Climate change is a powerful disease effect modifier. This means that at current temperatures, exisXng climatesensiXve health impacts are made worse than in previous Xmes of lower average temperatures and more stable and
predictable weather.
This infographic summarizes in more detail the health risks that are amplified by climate change and the various
populaXons that are most vulnerable. Climate-sensiXve health risks are listed along the bobom panel in light aqua:
• injury and mortality from extreme weather events
• heat-related illness
• respiratory illness
• water-borne diseases and other water-related health impacts
• zoonoses
• vector-borne diseases
• malnutriXon and food-borne diseases
• noncommunicable diseases
• mental and psychosocial health (1).
While climate change ulXmately affects everyone and all species, there are specific populaXons that are at the
highest risk. The vulnerability factors on the top leuhand side help to idenXfy populaXons at parXcular risk to
suffering earlier and more severely from climate-related diseases, injuries and deaths. These factors include:
• demographic
• geographic
• biological and health status
• sociopoliXcal condiXons
• socioeconomic factors (1).
In the next few slides, the module will explore each category through the lens of children’s special vulnerabiliXes.

While climate change ulXmately affects all people, the harbingers of these effects will be felt within specific
populaXons (1). Some of the populaXon groups that will be most vulnerable to climate-related health consequences
include:
• people in the extremes of age - the very young and the very old;
• those who are malnourished, ill and/or living with a disability are more likely to suffer from climate-related illhealth, injury or death;
• populaXons in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs);
• poor communiXes and people living in poverty, including poor communiXes in high-income countries (HICs);
• people with lible or limited access to educaXon;
• migrants and displaced persons; and
• those who live and/or work outside.
Children fall disproporXonately into all of these higher risk categories and are ouen among the most vulnerable to
harm mediated through environmental exposure. Many children fall into mulXple risk categories. For example, in
2021, 42% of the populaXon living in low-income countries were under the age of 15 (2).
Climate change as it affects risk of exisXng condiXons and diseases, follows a similar pabern as environmental
exposures in the general populaXon and children are disproporXonately affected.

MAGNITUDE
OF THE PROBLEM
In 2021, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) published a new index of risk called the Children’s Climate Risk
Index. The index identifies seven climate-related health risks: heatwaves, cyclones, riverine and coastal flooding,
water scarcity, vector-borne illness and air pollution. It also identifies lead pollution as an additional major
environmental risk (1).
Using sophisticated geographic information system (GIS) technology, the mapping estimates populations of children
at risk. The index compiles these into maps and identifies geographical areas where children are at risk from from
overlapping environmental hazards, shocks and stresses. The map on this slide illustrates the distribution of risk
categories from low risk in yellow (0–2 climate and environmental shocks) to extremely high risk in brown (more
than seven climate and environmental shocks) (1).
This map shows the distribution of climate and environmental shocks with almost every child on earth estimated to
be exposed to at least one major climate or environment-related shock. An estimated 330 million children were
exposed to five or more overlapping major climate or environment-related shocks, and an estimated 80 million
children were exposed to at least six (1).
The Children’s Climate Risk Index estimates the number of children exposed to the following climate and
environmental shocks (1):
• 2 billion children (almost 90% of children globally) exposed to air pollution;
• 920 million (over one third of children globally) exposed to water scarcity;
• 820 million (one third of children globally) exposed to heatwaves;
• 600 million (more than one in four children globally) exposed to vector-borne diseases;
• 400 million (nearly one in six children globally) exposed to cyclones;
• 330 million (one in seven children globally) exposed to riverine flooding; and
• 240 million (one in ten children globally) exposed to coastal flooding.

Climate and environmental shocks
The Children’s Climate Risk Index is composed of two pillars. First, the climate and environmental hazards that were
illustrated in the previous slide. The second pillar is an analysis of the geographic distribution of children’s
vulnerability as measured by (1):
• child health and nutrition
• education
• water, sanitation and hygiene
• poverty, communications assets and societal protection.
The map on this slide shows the distribution of risk categorization, combining these two pillars from low to
extremely high. Using this methodology, nearly half of the world’s children (approximately 1 billion children)
were living in extremely high-risk countries according to the Children’s Climate Risk Index (1). These areas are also
among the poorest in the world.
In the next section, this module explores why and how this is of great concern for children and their futures.
Children often suffer first and most severely from environmental hazards. Climate-related diseases and injuries are
no exception (2).

Children are not little adults. Children have particular vulnerabilities that mean they are especially sensitive to the
effects of climate change. Children’s vulnerability is often divided into the four general categories described here.
1. Children often have different and unique exposures to environmental hazards compared to adults. Children can
be exposed in utero to chemical (pollutants and pharmaceuticals), physical (radiation, heat) and biological (viral,
parasitic) agents. They can also be exposed, after birth, to pollutants that pass into their mother’s breastmilk.
Neither of these routes of exposure occur in adults or older children. Children also have pathways of exposure that
differ from those of adults due to their size and developmental stage. For example, young children engage in normal
exploratory behaviours including hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth behaviours, and non-nutritive ingestion
which may dramatically increase exposure over that in adults. Additionally, children live closer to the ground and
have greater surface area to volume ratios than adults, which consequently may cause higher exposure to pollutants
that settle close to the ground, or which are absorbed through the skin (1,2).
2. Due to their dynamic developmental physiology children are often subjected to higher exposures to pollutants
found in air, water and food. Because they are anabolic and rapidly growing, children breathe more air, eat more
food and drink more water per kilogram body weight than adults and often absorb nutrients more efficiently.
Therefore, pollutants can result in higher internal doses in children compared to adults. These exposures may be
metabolized and excreted quite differently by an immature set of systems compared to the way they are dealt with
in mature, adult systems. Furthermore, the developmental component of a child’s physiology is changing; maturing,
differentiating and growing in phases known as "developmental windows". These phases can be understood as
"windows of vulnerability" and create unique risks for children exposed to hazards which can permanently alter
normal function and structure in ways with no analogs in adults similarly exposed. Due to cognitive immaturity,
children may have more limited ability to understand and move out of danger, both from toxic agents and
dangerous situations which could result in harm. This characteristic is clear in the pre-ambulatory period, but also
persists through exploratory toddler behaviour and even into the high-risk behaviours seen in adolescence (1,3).
3. Children have a longer life expectancy, so they have longer to manifest a disease with a long latency period, and
longer to live with toxic damage which may manifest in childhood or much later in life (2).
4. Finally, children are dependent upon adults to protect them and ensure a safe environment. The photo on this
slide shows a statue of a young child, gazing in wonder at the world with trust and curiosity. It was designed by the
artist to represent any ethnicity or race, and she is wearing a simple garment that could be from anywhere in the
world. Children trust the adults in their lives to nurture and protect them through actions and decisions until they

can protect themselves through their own individual, collective and political action (2). Children are
not little adults.
Depending upon the climate-related health hazard, these general vulnerabilities may explain the
excess burden of disease suffered by children in different ways. Throughout this presentation, the
module will return to these categories to help highlight why child health care workers and public
health practitioners should be especially concerned for the children under their care exposed to
climate- and environment-related hazards (4).
Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on
climate-related health impact categories, the module will explore how children are affected in the
following series of slides.
Note: for more information, please see the available modules on Children are not little adults and

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) has organized the health
impacts of climate change into three broad categories as shown on this slide (1).
Each of these categories are explored in the following slides with emphasis on children’s increased risk.
Note: at the time of this module update, the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) was still under final review. Users
of this module may wish to consult this report once it is published, which is anticipated to be late 2022 or early
2023.

HEALTH EFFECTS:
DIRECT IMPACTS
Heat-related mortality and morbidity are clear direct health impacts linked to climate change. While heat-related
deaths occur primarily in the elderly, a systematic review has found increased vulnerability in young children as well
(1). A growing literature base is documenting risks to children from increasing ambient heat. In the very young this is
likely due to an immature thermal regulatory system as well as infant’s dependence upon adults to keep them in
safe environments, which may significantly explain the higher risk in this age group (2).
The graphs shown here come from a 30-year study in Canada that found a strong association between high
temperatures and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), particularly in the 3–12 months old age group (3). Odds
ratios for SIDS (y-axis) are plotted against maximum temperatures (x-axis) shown in blue, with the dotted lines
showing the 95% confidence intervals (CI); odds are relative to 20 degrees Celsius (°C). Infants, 1–2 months old, are
shown in the top graphs, and infants 3–12 months old are shown in the bottom graphs. Graphs on the left show
odds ratios for SIDS based on previous day temperatures while graphs on the right show odds ratios for SIDS based
on same-day temperatures. For the bottom right graph, with maximum same-day temperatures of 29°C or more,
there was a 2.78 times greater chance of SIDS events in infants 3–12 months old relative to when the maximum
temperature was 20°C (3). At least two additional studies have found significant positive associations with SIDS and
increased ambient temperature (4,5).
Adverse birth outcomes, including preterm births and stillbirths, are increased with greater ambient heat (2,6).
Similarly, emergency department visits and hospitalizations for renal and electrolyte disturbances, lower respiratory
disease, heat stroke and heat exhaustion all increase with higher temperatures (2,7).
Child labour in agriculture and other outdoor child labour puts the young at special risk during periods of intense

A second category of direct impacts are those related to increases in extreme weather events such as droughts and
wildfires, storms and floods, and extreme precipitation. A warmer atmosphere holds more water, and warmer
oceans fuel more intense storms. Changes in precipitation patterns enhance both drought and flood (1). Under
these conditions, children are at increased risk of death and injury as they are physically dependent upon adults to
protect and remove them from dangerous situations (2). Newborns (0–28 days old), infants (1–11 months old) and
young children (1–4 years old) are at the highest risk (3).
As these events become both more severe and frequent in a warmer and less stable climate, more and more
children will be exposed to climate change-related danger and harm. A report published in 2013 indicated that
children from the poorest families are up to 10 times more likely to suffer from climate-related disasters than
children from wealthier circumstances (4).
Severe weather events have many effects on child health. Globally, women and young children are more vulnerable
to the acute impacts of natural disasters and famines; a 2013 reported suggested they were 14 times more likely to
die in a disaster than men. Floods cause child injuries and death by drowning, and compromise clean water supplies,
fostering epidemics of diarrhoea (4).
Weather disasters devastate homes, spawning refugee communities that are likely to have poor public health. Basic
life support systems, including water, forests and other natural resources, may also be undermined by climate
change. Food production and availability are affected by droughts and floods. Children are especially vulnerable to
the emotional trauma caused by sudden changes in living routines and social networks. The social disruption,
economic damage and population displacement caused by weather disasters can harm children’s psychological and
social development (2,5).

Children’s vulnerabiliXes in the four generic categories are specified for the direct effects of climate change due to
heat and weather disasters are listed on this slide.
1. Infants leu inside ”safe places”, such as locked cars, may rapidly succumb to heat stroke and even death (1).
2. Physiologically, infants have immature thermoregulatory systems. Children also have higher metabolic rates
than adults and can more rapidly become dehydrated (1).
3. Some more subtle ways children suffer disproporXonately include early and prolonged disrupHon of educaHon
due to climate changed-related events or illness, which may affect future employment and success. Early
trauma from climate-related disasters, disrupXng family and community, may cause long-term psychological
harm and mental health issues (2).
4. Adolescent risk-taking behaviour can lead to increased and dangerous heat exposure during work or sporXng
acXviXes (1).

Climate change affects ecosystems upon which humans and all living creatures depend. These ecosystem mediated
impacts, as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) health experts, fall into several
categories. The first is air quality.
Poor air quality is especially dangerous to children as they (1):
• spend more time outside than adults;
• are more physically active;
• breathe more air per unit body weight;
• have immature and developing lungs susceptible to damage.
As the climate continues to change, it is expected that air pollution-related illnesses will increase through several
mechanisms (2).
Ground-level ozone increases with temperature (1). Ozone is a powerful irritant that causes inflammation and is
sometimes called “sunburn of the lungs” (1). In asthmatics, ozone triggers more frequent and more severe asthma
attacks, as measured by emergency room visits (3). There is evidence that long-term exposure to ozone can
contribute to the development of new asthma cases and to decrease in lung function (4,5). Ozone production
increases with temperature (even without additional precursors), so in a hotter world, there will be more ozone
pollution (6).
Note: for more information, please see the available modules on Ambient air pollution and Childhood respiratory
diseases linked to the environment.

The second category of air pollution related illness derives from fossil fuel pollution driven by an increasing
population and greater demand for energy.
If increased energy demand is met by burning more fossil fuels, all major air pollutants will also increase. The
burning of more fossil fuels will result in increased levels of (1,2):
• particulates (PM)
• nitrogen oxides (NOx)
• sulfur dioxide (SO2)
• volatile organic hydrocarbons (VOCs)
• polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
• ozone (O3).
There is robust evidence that childhood exposure to these specific air pollutants is linked to (1,3):
• decrease in lung growth and permanent decrements in pulmonary function
• increase in:
o respiratory infections
o asthma incidence and attacks
o infant and all age mortality,
o miscarriages, preterm birth and low birth weight.
Additionally, mercury, which pollutes the air primarily from coal burning, can also pollute the food chain. Mercury is
a known neurotoxicant and threatens the development of children’s brains and nervous systems (4).

The third category of air quality-related health impacts is aeroallergens.
Children have a high prevalence of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Evidence suggests that prevalence of both
allergic rhinitis and asthma is changing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (1). Climate change is
exacerbating this problem through several ecosystem mediated processes (2).
As temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2
) increase, research is documenting a variety of changes in
aeroallergens. In many areas in the world, blooming seasons are prolonged because of later first frosts and earlier
thaws. Ziska et al. documented an overall increase of ragweed (a common weed in North America) growing season
from 13–27 days between 1995 and 2009, depending upon latitude (3). Similar findings exist for other important
aeroallergens associated with human sensitivity and disease (4). Children have a high prevalence of respiratory
allergies, and more prevalent allergic asthma triggers due to climate change translates into more disease.
Research has also shown that in environments with high CO2
, plants produce not only more pollen, but more
allergenic proteins (4). Thus, both an increase in length of blooming time and enriched allergen production, children
with allergic disease and allergic triggers to their asthma will be more likely to suffer symptoms for longer and more
intensely as the climate continues to warm.
As with all climate-related health threats, regional difference are highly variable. The very complex interactions of
allergic pollens, weather and climate have been reviewed in a statement from the World Allergy Organization (1).

Air quality is parXcularly important for children’s health and development.
Children ouen have ĚŝīĞƌĞŶƚ nd ƵŶŝƋƵĞ ĞǆƉŽƐƵƌĞƐ to air polluXon compared to adults. Because children are small
and frequently play close to the ground, both inside and outside, their exposure to some pollutants may be
increased compared to adults. Children also ouen engage in vigorous physical acXvity, which can increase their
exposure to dirty air (1).
Due to their ĚǇŶĂŵŝĐ ĚĞǀĞůŽƉŵĞŶƚĂů ƉŚǇƐŝŽůŽŐǇ children are ouen subjected to higher exposure to pollutants found
in the air.
Because they are anabolic and rapidly growing, they breathe more air per kilogram body weight than adults. An
infant at rest breathes at a rate about five Xmes that of an adult, while young children 3–5 years of age breathe at a
rate 60% higher than that of adults. Thus, environmental toxicants in the air are delivered to children at higher
internal doses relaXve to adults (2). Children have high rates of mouth-breathing, bypassing nasal filtraXon, which
can also expose them to higher levels of air polluXon (1).
In terms of developmental physiology, children have immature immune, respiratory and central nervous systems and
are highly sensiXve to environmental sXmuli, including polluted air (3). The immature respiratory system is the
primary target of air polluXon. At birth, a newborn has only about 30–50% of the alveoli that will be present in
adulthood (4). Alveolar development occurs most rapidly during the first two years of life, though it may conXnue
unXl 8 years of age (5). During this period, children experience a higher raXo of lung surface area to lung volume
than adults, as well as having larger lung surface area to body weight raXo relaXve to adults. The inside lining of the
respiratory tract is permeable in young children, making them especially vulnerable to irritants in the airways (4). All
these factors facilitate increased absorpXon of parXcles from air polluXon.
Airway passages in children are smaller than those in adults. InflammaXon resulXng from air polluXon irritants
causes proporXonately greater airway obstrucXon. InflammaXon caused by air polluXon that may produce only a
small response in an adult can result in potenXally significant obstrucXon in a young child’s airways (6).
Windows of vulnerability for permanent alternaXons in lung funcXon persist throughout childhood. While alveolar
development is substanXally complete by 2 years, lung growth conXnues through adolescence and parallels somaXc
growth. It is thought to be complete by approximately 18 years in females and 20-23 years in males (4,5). UnXl adult
systems are fully developed, exposures to air polluXon may alter funcXon in both reversible and irreversible ways.

Finally, cogniXve immaturity also increases children’s risk to dirty air. Young children do not know to
stay away from sources of air polluXon, and the youngest children lack the capacity to move away at
all. Children are less likely than adults to cease acXvity when they begin to have respiratory symptoms
such as bronchospasm, so can have prolonged exposure and become more acutely ill (1).
Because children have longer life expectancies than adults, any chronic condiXons developed in
childhood can affect the enXre lifeXme. Chronic illness can prevent children from going to school,
affecXng academic achievement. Furthermore, health effects due to air polluXon have Xme to manifest
for diseases with long latency. Environmental insults to children early in life will affect them for years to
come (1,7).
Finally, children depend upon adultsto provide a safe environment in which to grow, develop and
thrive (1).

respiratory diseases linked to the environment.

Water-borne infecXons are another example of ecosystem-mediated health impacts.
In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), access to clean and safe water is a major issue in many
communiXes. Inadequate access to clean and safe water is likely to be exacerbated by water scarcity and
temperature effects due to climate change.
Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease every year (1). It is the fourth leading
cause of death in children under 5 years of age. In 2019, diarrhoeal diseases caused an esXmated 484 000 deaths in
children under 5 years globally (2). The World Health OrganizaXon (WHO) esXmates that in the year 2030, climate
change will be responsible for an addiXonal 48 000 deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases in children under 15 years of
age. Almost all these deaths are expected to be concentrated in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (3).
Even in high-income countries (HICs) with well-developed public health infrastructure and early warning systems,
there is correlaXon between heavy rain events and water-borne infecXons. Climate change-related heavy rain events
are expected to damage urban infrastructure and reduce water availability. Currently, few household water and
sanitaXon technologies are resilient to these effects(3).
Finally, diarrhoeal diseases are highly sensiXve to climaXc condiXons and show strong seasonal variaXons in many
locaXons (3). The usual posiXve correlaXon of diarrhoeal disease with temperature reflects the fact that most cases
in tropical developing countries are caused by bacteria, entamoebae and protozoa, all of which are favoured by high
temperatures. As well as meteorological influences on microbial exposures, incidence of childhood diarrhoeal
disease may also increase as drinking water can become contaminated by toxins from warming-induced algal
blooms. Future changes in mean climaXc condiXons and in the occurrence of extreme weather events are likely to
significantly affect the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in children (4).

Food-borne diseases are also likely to increase with climate change. Currently, children under 5, particularly those
living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), bear a disproportionate burden of food-borne diseases and
death. In 2010, an estimated 420 000 people died globally from food-borne diseases, including 125 000 children
under the age of 5 years (1,2).
The increase in food-borne diseases will be partly due to changes in global eating behaviour and partly due to
warmer weather, allowing many food-borne pathogens to grow faster. Increases in food-borne diseases will likely
lead to an annual increase in cases of childhood diarrhoeal diseases and consequently more hospitalizations due to
diarrhoeal-related dehydration (3).

Under the conditions of rapid global warming, changes in precipitation patterns and humidity levels; vector-borne
pathogens and subsequent disease patterns will also change. This figure from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) illustrates the complexities of these relationships. The graphic shows data on selected vectorborne diseases between 2008 and 2012, their distribution, burden of disease and various global and local climate
sensitive components. For example (1):
• dengue was associated with climate variables at a high level of confidence at both global and local levels;
• malaria and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were positively associated with climate variables at the
local level with high confidence.
The complexity of the graphic highlights the importance of local, national and regional preparedness and response.
Climate change is altering the pattern of vector-borne diseases as some insects and rodents respond quickly to
changes in temperature and moisture by migrating and increasing in numbers. The reproduction and survival of
blood-feeding vector organisms, such as mosquitoes and ticks, are greatly affected by climate and other ecological
factors. Higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, and altered climate variability may therefore change the
distribution of vector-borne diseases, both spatially and seasonally. Immunologically naive populations may thus
face unfamiliar pathogens (1). In some locations, climate change may lead to a decrease in some vector-borne
diseases due to reduced rainfall or excessively high temperatures (2).
In general, without strong public health defences, the anticipated increase in range and seasonality of pathogens
and their vector organisms will cause a greater incidence of various vector-borne diseases. Children are particularly
susceptible to malaria, dengue fever and various forms of encephalitis (2). For example, the prevalence of these
vector-borne diseases is likely to increase with climate change as higher temperatures are expected to (2):
• accelerate vector life cycle
• shorten incubation time of the parasite in the vector
• prolong transmission seasons.
Furthermore, higher temperatures will change the range of vectors both in latitude and altitude. One example is
ticks. Ticks that harbour the Borrelia bacterium, which causes Lyme disease, are now endemic in Canada and parts
of Scandinavia and cases of Lyme disease are on the rise (3).

Malaria is the most deadly vector-borne disease in the world. Five species of Plasmodium parasites are responsible
for malaria transmission, mostly via the Anopheles mosquito. In 2020, almost half of the global population was at
risk of malaria and malaria was endemic in 85 countries. There was an estimated 241 million cases of malaria
globally in 2020 (1).
In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an estimated 627 000 deaths due to malaria globally. More
than 486 000 children under the age of 5 years died in 2020 due to malaria. The highest rates of death and disease
burden from malaria occur in the WHO’s African Region, which carries 95% of malaria cases and 96% of all malarial
deaths. 80% of deaths in Africa were among children under the age of 5 (1).
Children experience disproportionately high levels of both morbidity and mortality from malaria. Young children
have little specific immunity to malarial species and may suffer annual attacks of debilitating and potentially fatal
disease. Children are also more susceptible to cerebral malaria and severe anaemia, which can lead to death (1).
Malaria incidence is nonlinearly related to temperature. Small increases in temperature can lead to major increases
in malaria cases. Increased temperatures may expand the geographical range of conditions conducive to malaria
transmission; both to higher altitudes and to higher latitudes. Furthermore, elevated temperatures in combination
with conducive patterns of rainfall and surface water, may extend the malaria transmission season in some locations
(2).

Paediatricians and other child health care professionals are very familiar with the unique susceptibilities of children
to many infections. Some of these vulnerabilities are listed on the slide. Exposures in children may be different and
unique such as (1):
• in utero exposure to maternal infection;
• higher exposure due to hand-mouth activity and poor hand hygiene;
• more time spent outside where exposure may be increased.
Immature immune response may increase vulnerability to certain infections. Children are also more prone to
dehydration due to greater need for fluids. Some antimicrobials may not be safe for use in children and some
measures to reduce exposure, such as pesticides to control vectors, may pose additional risks. Children have longer
to suffer consequences to infections which affect nutrition and growth or disrupt schooling. Finally, children depend
upon adults to keep them safe (1).
Climate-related infections can vary by (1):
• age
• infection agent
• locally-available treatment
• locally-available or affordable preventive measures
• any comorbidities at the time of infection.
It is critically important for health care providers who look after children to anticipate differing patterns of disease as
climate conditions change locally. Response should include the institutionalization of preventive public health
measures as well as being prepared to treat children who contract these food-, water- and vector-borne diseases.
Note: highlight the climate-related infections most relevant in your region.
Note: for information on the risks posed by pesticides to children’s health, see the available module on Pesticides.

The final category in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) is
climate-related health effects mediated through human institutions.
These are perhaps the most difficult problems for paediatricians and other health care workers to approach. Climate
change represents a serious threat to achieving long-term aspirations of alleviating global food and water insecurity
and ensuring global peace and social equity. All of these can dramatically affect children’s growth and development
and their very survival.
While not directly related to patient care, these challenges serve as motivation to those who work on behalf of
children and future generations. They are reviewed very briefly in the following slides.

CLIMATE CHANGE
How climate change affects health
• Direct impacts
• Extreme heat
• Extreme weather events
• Mediated through ecosystems
• Air pollution
• Food- and water-borne infections
• Vector-borne disease
• Mediated through human institutions
• Undernutrition
• Occupational and outdoor exposures
• Displacement, mental stress and violence
HEALTH EFFECTS:
HUMAN INSTITUTIONS
The complex health effects associated with climate change are significantly mediated by the status and trajectories
of human institutions.
Nutrition is one of the most critical determinants of child health. Child nutrition depends upon access to a
wholesome, adequate, and nourishing food supply. Agricultural production can be reduced by high temperatures
and changes in precipitation, resulting in both lower quantity and quality food. Farm worker productivity may also
be significantly affected by high temperatures. Research has found links between the increase in atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2) and decreases in the quality of some food plants, particularly those containing protein. Indeed,
climate change is already a threat in the most food-insecure regions of the world. Food price and production, levels
of development and poverty and baseline health all play a role in ensuring that children have enough high quality
food for optimal growth and development (1).
Many occupations that are necessary for robust societal infrastructure may be affected by climate change. Farm
workers and other outdoor workers may be at high risk of heat stress, extreme weather events, vectors of disease
and other climate-related effects. These may have productivity and health consequences in the future (2).
Mental health may be compromised due to local, regional and global responses to progressive climate change and
represent both acute and chronic stressors. Children and adolescents are more prone than other groups to anxiety,
depression and post-traumatic stress disorder related to climate-related disasters, which may be more common in a
warming and less stable climate. Climate-related disasters can also influence family stability and access to
education, which further affects children’s mental health (3). Research has suggested that in 2019 more than 50
million children worldwide had already been forced to leave their homes due to climate-related events (4). As
resource availability changes, and in some areas declines, resource-related conflict is possible and forced migration
may occur (3). The mental health of families is critical to children’s development throughout childhood. The
disruptions of a warmer and less stable climate system pose increasingly serious threats to child wellbeing and
mental health.

There is growing appreciation of the interdependent nature of all natural systems and human civilization. The Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was in the final stages of editing
and approval at the time this module was revised. In the Summary for Policy Makers for Working Group I, tasked
with assessing climate change’s impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, the approach was revised from the Fifth
Assessment Report (AR5). The revised approach shows more interaction among traditionally siloed sectors (1).
Throughout the AR6 this theme is emphasized: “This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems
and biodiversity, and human societies and integrates knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social
and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments (1).”
Similarly, in 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Lancet
Commission assessed the impact that climate change is having on children’s futures. The Commission identified the
need to place children at the center of all development goals in light of the urgent threats from climate change,
environmental degradation and global social inequity (2).
Children require stability, nurturing, clean, safe environments and healthy food for optimal growth and
development. Societal institutions that traditionally provide for this include:
• family and community
• childcare, school and education facilities
• health and public health facilities
• government bodies.
Yet these institutions are all threatened by the uncertainty of accelerating climate change. Children around the
world report anxiety, worry and fear in relation to climate change (3).

Children are particularly vulnerable to the climate change-related impacts on human institutions as the changes
seen today not only affect their current health and wellbeing, but also their future potential. Revisiting the rubric of
children’s special vulnerabilities, the threats to human institutions are felt throughout children’s lives as the affect
community, education, health care delivery and political stability. As the effects of climate change become
increasingly disruptive, the children of today will be required to cope with a less stable and predictable set of human
institutions compared to previous generations (1).
The lives of children born in this century will be different from the lives of children born into a more stable climate.
Furthermore, children do not have significant political voice or agency. They rely upon adults to make decisions that
will protect their future.

Having completed the review of climate change-related effects on child health, the module discusses the specific
roles of the health sector in responding to the threats from climate change.
These roles have been organized into three categories:
• adaptation strategies to climate change that will protect children;
• mitigation strategies to climate change that will protect future generations; and
• education and advocacy strategies that will promote awareness and engage larger numbers of colleagues,
families and citizens in addressing climate change.
Note on terminology: throughout this section the terms “adaptation” and “mitigation” are used according to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) definitions:
• adaptation: the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems,
adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human
intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (1);
• mitigation: a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (1).

CLIMATE CHANGE
Outline
1. Magnitude of the problem
• Humans have changed the climate
• Children are among the most vulnerable
2. Effects on children’s health from climate change
• Direct health impacts
• Ecosystem-mediated impacts
• Impacts mediated through human institutions
3. Role of paediatricians in protecting child health
• Adaptation strategies
• Mitigation strategies
• Education and advocacy
Adapting to climate change is one of the most important points of this module.
As the climate has already changed and will continue to do so for at least two decades no matter the global
response today. Adaptation is now critical (1). The health risks this module has explored will increase as the planet
continues to warm and weather events become increasingly severe and unpredictable. The physics of the climate
system mean that even if all greenhouse gas emissions were to cease today, global temperatures would continue to
rise as the system equilibrates.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has named this equilibration as the “era of committed
climate change.” These target-style graphs show the projected relative proportion (the width between the arrows)
of each health threat as well as the magnitude or number of people affected by the number of circle segments. The
critical feature to understand from these circles is that the dark red circles represent the amount that health
impacts can be reduced with a higher level of adaptation than is currently being used. If nothing is done, the poor
health outcomes increase dramatically. If countries work collectively to develop robust adaptive strategies, these
can be reduced to the smaller yellow circles (the unavoidable increased health hazards). These adaptive strategies
could save lives and preserve the health of many people (1).
As children bear a disproportionately high health burden from climate change, it is essential that paediatricians and
other health care workers are included at all levels of adaptation strategy development and implementation.
Note: at the time of this revision, the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) IPCC was in final stages of editing and approval.
It does not currently include this particular adaptation framework. When the AR6 is finalized, it is anticipated that
the adaptation options will remain important, but the predicted efficacy may be less optimistic making action today
of paramount importance (2).

The power of adaptation is illustrated in this case study from Bangladesh.
This example is offered as proof of the adaption concept; that even very large problems can be collectively
managed. While not specifically in response to climate change, Bangladesh has made dramatic improvements in
disaster preparedness over the past 40 years. As an area vulnerable to flooding, storm surges and wind damage
from frequent cyclones, Bangladesh assembled a multi-sector, multi-pronged approach to disaster preparedness
which has saved lives (1). The adaptions have occurred across three categories (2):
1. general disaster education, aided by increased literacy rates, has better prepared the public for cyclones;
2. early warning systems, from high-tech information to bicycle-relayed messaging, alert communities to
imminent danger; and
3. designated shelters give people a safe place to go during cyclones. The photo on the slide shows a cyclone
shelter in Bangladesh.
The dramatic reduction in lives lost from similar or worsening storms, despite the country’s population increase of
30 million in the same time period, is testimony to the power of adaptation (World Health Organization,
unpublished report, 2022).
Considering that the risks from climate change are guaranteed to increase over the next several decades even if
global response to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is robust and swift, this example is powerful and heartening.

Another example of climate-adaption comes from Nepal.
In Shankarnaga, a town in southern Nepal, the local water authority identified the increasing risk of water supply
interruption due to (World Health Organization, unpublished report, 2022):
• climate-related floods
• landslides
• related power outages.
As an adaption strategy, seven emergency hand pumps were installed in strategic areas of the community to allow
residents to access clean water during power outages. This project was funded through the World Health
Organization (WHO), by United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’s Department for International
Development (DFID) with the support of regional offices and local government (1, World Health Organization,
unpublished report, 2022).

Paediatricians and other health care professionals have unique roles in planning and responding on behalf of
children. Vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, mothers, infants and children, require special attention in
patient care, disaster planning and community efforts. This should be an exercise in collaboration among multiple
sectors (1,2).
Paediatricians and other health care professionals can work on many levels to address climate change, for example
(3,4):
• at the clinic level in direct patient care
• at the public health level
• at the community level.
The ongoing process of tailoring climate adaptation to the local and regional conditions, in cooperation with all
sectors and leadership, is critically important.

CriLcal role of health care professionals
Approaches to adapta%on
Each location and region has its own complement of climate-related health risks, consequently all adaptation
strategies must be specific for a particular area, community or region (1–3). At a minimum, all adaptation strategies
should include those listed on the slide.
For paediatricians, adaptation should always include specific consideration of children’s vulnerabilities and needs.
Paediatricians and all maternal and child health professionals should be integral parts of planning and implementing
these strategies at all levels from local to global.
“The present health status of a population may be the single most important predictor of both the future health
impacts of climate change and the costs of adaptation (4).”

Paediatricians and other child health care providers are uniquely situated to highlight children and their needs when
considering climate-adaption strategies. This can be done by identifying appropriate child-centred resources, such
as the World Health Organization’s (WHO) atlas on children’s health and the environment (1) and considering
available research and data during development and implementation of adaptation strategies (2).
Collecting real world stories of the impact of climate change on children and using them to illustrate and emphasize
the importance of including child-centric considerations in all planning can be a powerful strategy for health care
providers.
Paediatricians are also in an ideal position to work with teams of parents, teachers and child-care workers, alongside
local authorities, to ensure that adaption strategies will protect the health, wellbeing and futures of children.
Finally, health care professionals can use the long tradition of anticipatory guidance to develop educational
materials on climate adaptation strategies that specifically address the special needs of children. This may include
the use of (3):
• air quality indices
• heat warnings
• emergency preparation.

ADAPTATION
STRATEGIES
An example of an adaptaXon strategy is the Extreme Heat Response Program designed to operate at the local level
in the United States of America.
This programme involves using heat health watch warning systems to iniXate responses. The acXons include:
• acXvaXng telephone heat hotlines as a source of public advice;
• alerXng neighbourhood volunteers, family members and friends to check on each other;
• providing public air-condiXoned buildings and transportaXon to these faciliXes;
• working with local schools and childcare faciliXes to protect at-risk individuals;
• coordinaXng with local uXlity companies to ensure that service to residenXal electricity customers is not shut off
during a heat wave (1).
This intervenXon also advocates for special care of vulnerable populaXons, including the elderly, those experiencing
homelessness and outdoor labourers. AcXons to protect vulnerable populaXons include (1):
• working with local “aging agencies” to educate at-risk elderly individuals;
• conducXng outreach to at-risk individuals experiencing homelessness;
• modifying or cancelling outdoor labour and sports.
Local medical infrastructure must be adapted to ensure adequate emergency room and inpaXent capacity for those
who slip through the cracks of any intervenXon.

ADAPTATION
STRATEGIES
The next crucial step in the response to climate change is mitigation. Adapting to and developing climate resilience
are not sufficient.
Changes in the actions that the global society takes NOW regarding greenhouse gas emissions, energy choices, landuse choices and population control will determine how much climate change will occur in the second half of the 21st
century and beyond. Notice that in the “era of climate options,” the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) draws the risk profile for a 4 degrees Celsius (°C) temperature rise. This is the temperature rise anticipated if
humanity continues along current emissions pathways without any new adaptation or mitigation strategies. Without
new strategies, the health risks become enormous and many will be beyond our capacity for adaption (1).
The IPCC also discusses “adaptation limits” – temperatures above which human adaptation is not possible. Humans
have physiological limits to heat tolerance which could ultimately make some areas of the globe uninhabitable.
Unchecked, severe climate change may cause the displacement of millions of people from their homes,
consequently placing more pressure on areas that are still suitable for human inhabitation. Limits to food
production and human nutrition under high temperatures are also likely. As the IPCC states, “there may be a
threshold of global warming beyond which current agricultural practices can no longer support large human
civilizations (1)”.
Adaptations that are heavily reliant on infrastructure, such as large-scale air conditioning, risk placing vulnerable
populations at heightened risk of power outages and failures. Moreover, many experts believe that the effects of
climate change will not be smooth or linear. Rather, there may be a tipping point after which a system changes
dramatically and irreversibly, significantly affecting human health and welfare. These non-linear changes cannot
easily be anticipated and, once they occur, could have serious consequences.
Thus, the future of human health depends greatly upon human choices to mitigate climate change now. There is an
urgent need to curtail greenhouse gas emissions globally and increase carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks (natural places
where CO2 is sequestered, such as forests and soils) now to keep global warming to a manageable minimum.
Note: the width of the slices represents the relative proportion or burden of disease at the population level in each
category. The rings represent risk levels with the darker red colour indicating risks that could be improved by
intensive adaptation efforts. Yellow rings represent risks that cannot be changed by aggressive adaptation. The
higher the global temperature, the more rings will turn yellow and the less human society will be able to adapt (1).

The contribuXon of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) was released in summary form in 2021. The strong conclusion is that humanity must act
quickly now to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in order to limit global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) by 2100 (1).
With every increment of increased warming, impacts on natural and human systems worsen and funcXonal
adaptaXon becomes more costly and increasingly less effecXve. The AR6 summary stresses that many of the changes
caused by anthropogenic emissions will be irreversible for centuries or even millennia, especially those related to
oceans, ice sheets and sea level (1). Emission reducXon scenarios modelled in the AR6 found that only the most
aggressive strategies were “very likely” (90%) to achieve success by 2100 (1).
Simultaneous miXgaXon and local, regional and internaXonal adaptaXon strategies are needed urgently.

The good news is that across all sectors, climate mitigation strategies improve public health. The health benefits
from climate actions are well-documented and offer strong arguments for transformative change (1).
For the scenarios that have been analyzed, the savings in health-related economic costs (from loss of productivity
and health care expenditures) from climate-related health harms is greater than the economic cost of climate
mitigation strategies used to reduce them. In other words, it is both less expensive and more effective to protect
human health through climate mitigation than to address the health consequences once they have occurred (1,2).
The graphic on this slide comes from the “six-sector solution” concept from the United Nations Environment
Programme’s (UNEP) 2020 Emissions Gap Report (3). In each of the major sectors producing the most carbon
emissions, there are solutions that not only reduce these emissions but also support health. For example (3):
• replacing fossil fuel-generated energy with zero emission renewables would reduce all harmful air pollutants,
which in turn would reduce all air pollution-related illness and death;
• transforming the transportation sector to encourage more mass transit, less individual vehicle travel and more
active transport options would both improve air quality and increase physical activity, consequently improving
overall health and fitness;
• decreasing deforestation and protecting ecosystems would reduce carbon in the atmosphere by providing
natural sinks and increasing greenspaces and natural landscapes, which can improve and support mental health;
• reducing food waste, limiting consumption of red meat and processed meat products and encouraging eating
habits that include a wide-variety of foods with an emphasis on plant-based and locally-produced foods will
improve nutrition and reduce noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some
cancers (4);
• retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency reduces greenhouse gases and saves money which can be
used to support health and social programmes.

MiXgaXon must include changes in personal acXons and choices wherever possible and pracXcal. The paediatric
community, accustomed to anXcipatory guidance, primary prevenXon and health values, can be leaders at the local
level in miXgaXon as well as adaptaXon. There are many ways to include miXgaXon strategies in everyday clinics.
Some ideas include (1):
• Personal level: calculate your carbon footprint. The carbon footprint is an esXmate of how much an individuals’
lifestyle contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. There are many available online resources for this purpose.
Then, work to reduce your carbon impact and tell the stories of how it has been done.
• Paediatric pracHce level: green your paediatric offices and insXtuXons, educate colleagues, staff, parents and
paXents about climate change and effecXve miXgaXon strategies.
• PoliHcal level: educate local decision-makers on the potenXal child health threats from unchecked climate
change in your area and the importance of proacXve and prevenXve measures. Engage with local and naXonal
government bodies and champion climate miXgaXon and adaptaXon strategies at the policy level.
There are several online resources available that include ideas for miXgaXon strategies in clinical seÄngs:
• Compendium of WHO and other UN guidance on health and environment (2)
• WHO guidance for climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health care faciliXes (3)
• Checklists to assess vulnerabiliXes in health care faciliXes in the context of climate change (4)

The urgent need for greenhouse gas mitigation also provides opportunities for health co-benefits through climate
protection strategies. The next few slides have examples of possible strategies that benefit health while also
reducing greenhouse gas emissions that are central to climate change. The examples are split into ideas for highincome countries (HICs) and for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
It is important to also note that strategies for reducing emissions depend on local contexts and practicalities.
Paediatricians can be leaders in finding these win-win solutions at the local level, and encouraging action across
many levels in order to capitalize on them.
Example ideas for reducing emissions and improving health in HICs include (1):
• improving public transport and encouraging active forms of transport, such as walking and cycling, will help
fight obesity and reduce traffic-related air pollution;
• encouraging social time instead of “screen” time and moving away from electronic entertainment to reduce
demand for energy and reinvigorate social interactions while also reducing isolation, anxiety and depression. This
may also encourage healthy, active, social play and sport;
• promoting crop diversity with an emphasis on plant-based and locally sourced diets will reduce emissions,
support local producers and improve nutrition;
• encouraging better energy-use choices that are efficient, consequently saving money that can be used to
support health, including medical costs.
Note: adapt this slide with examples of win-win solutions that are most appropriate for local conditions and
cultures.

Strategies to miXgate greenhouse gas emissions are likely to be different in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) than in high-income countries (HICs). For example, in 2020, 2.4 billion people globally used solid fuels and
inefficient technologies for cooking. Most of these people live in LMICs (1).
Example ideas for reducing emissions and improving health in LMICs include:
• adopHng clean renewable energy and establishing local electrical grids using renewable sources, providing
necessary power to families while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air polluXon-related
disease (2);
• developing and encouraging public transport systems, cycling and walking networks can reduce air polluXon,
noise, traffic-related injuries while promoXng physical acXvity and acXve transport (2);
• promoHng solar hot water and water conservaHon can reduce air polluXon by decreasing the use of polluXng
fuels and can save money that can be used for health purposes;
• strengthen tradiHonal diets that support local producers with an emphasis on plant-based diets, thereby

The COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 (and was ongoing during the update of this module) has taught
the global population many lessons. Among them has been the undeniable globally inequities in health and
vulnerability which mirror those of climate change.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a “manifesto” with six major prescriptions for a healthy and green
recovery and future. These prescriptions directly address climate change as one of the biggest health threat facing
humanity. These six prescriptions are (1–3):
1. Protect and preserve the source of human health: nature by reducing and eliminating:
• deforestation;
• intensive, polluting agricultural practices;
• unsafe management and consumption of wildlife.
2. Invest in essential services, from water and sanitation to clean energy in health care facilities by:
• ensuring universal household access to clean water and sanitation and hygiene facilities, including
soap;
• ensuring universal access to clean water and sanitation and hygiene facilities, including soap, in health
care facilities;
• ensuring health care facilities have reliable access to energy sources;
• investing in clean and renewable energy.
3. Ensure a quick and health energy transition by:
• investing in reliable, renewable and clean energy sources and infrastructure;
• ensuring safe and well-paid employment in the renewable energy sector.
4. Promote healthy, sustainable food systems by:
• encouraging transition to healthy, nutritious and sustainable diets;
• reducing land cleaning for livestock.
5. Build healthy, liveable cities by:
• improving and promoting public transport and active transport, such as walking and cycling.
6. Stop using taxpayers money to fund pollution by;
• placing a price on polluting fuels in line with the damage they cause.

The world is taking action on climate change.
The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Paris Agreement),
adopted on 12 December 2015, marked the beginning of a new era in the global response to climate change. The
Paris Agreement set out ambitious goals to keep global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius (°C),
preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels and committed countries to strengthen adaptation strategies
(1).
The publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) special report in 2018 emphasized the
need to go beyond the Paris Agreement and to keep global temperatures below 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial
levels to preserve a truly liveable planet for humans (2). Thus, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference
(COP26) in Glasgow 2021, the world set much more ambitions goals to do just that and quickly (3). Additionally,
COP26
Ensuring that children are fully protected from the health and societal consequences of climate change requires
urgent substantial global adjustments to current economic activity and technological choices. Better understanding
of the range and extent of the risks posed by climate change and broad global environmental changes will
strengthen the contribution of health sciences to sustainable environmental management (4).

Paediatricians and all health care providers who look after children and their families understand the importance of
placing children at the centre of a global transformation towards climate change and the environment. The World
Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Lancet Commission have issued a
manifesto that gives health care professionals a blueprint around which to organize practice and advocacy on behalf
of children’s health and futures.
The five points include (1,2):
1. stop carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with the utmost urgency, to ensure children have a future on this planet;
2. place children and adolescents at the centre of our efforts to achieve sustainable development;
3. new policies and investments in all sectors to work towards child health and rights;
4. incorporate children’s voices into policy decisions;
5. tighten national regulation of harmful commercial marketing, supported by a new Optional Protocol to the
United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Under the broad development ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an initiative has begun to
identify and work on synergies between the SDGs and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. This initiative recognizes overlapping goals of the two and aims to accelerate
progress towards both. This is positive news for the health and futures of children around the world (3).

Climate Change (IPCC) is finalized, it is clear that action must be taken immediately. Action is imperative if our
children are to inherit an inhabitable planet (1).
There is no time to waste.

Progress can and must be made in addressing current and future threats to children’s health from global climate
change. This quote is from the Bangkok Statement and emphasizes the urgent need to safeguard children’s
environmental health:
• For all those concerned about the environmental health of children, the time to translate knowledge into action
is now (1).
The threats to children’s environmental health must be addressed to ensure their futures.
