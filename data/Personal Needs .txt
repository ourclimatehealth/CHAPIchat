Are you resilient?
A person’s “resilience” is their ability to bounce back from a difficult or life-changing event—like the diagnosis of chronic disease or the impacts of a natural disaster. People are more resilient and better able to withstand, adapt to, and recover from adversity when they make healthy choices, including the decision to prepare for emergencies. Communities are more resilient when their citizens are prepared.
