ABSTRACT
After declining by 24.2% from 2009 to 2016, annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 
the United States in counties with monitors increased by 5.5% between 2016 and 2018. Increases 
occurred in multiple census regions and in counties that were in and out of attainment with 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). We explore channels through which the 
increase may have occurred including increases in economic activity, increases in wildfires, and 
decreases in Clean Air Act enforcement actions. The health implications of this increase in 
PM2.5 between 2016 and 2018 are significant. The increase was associated with 9,700 additional 
premature deaths in 2018. At conventional valuations, these deaths represent damages of $89 
billion.

Introduction
After a decade of improvement, annual average ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) in the
United States increased in 2017 and again in 2018. These increases are worrisome, because
previous studies have shown that PM2.5 increases premature mortality risk. This risk
comprises the largest share of monetary damages from air pollution (United States En-
vironmental Protection Agency, 1999, 2010a; Muller, Mendelsohn and Nordhaus, 2011).
Drawing on data for 2009-2018, this paper documents trends in PM2.5 and the im-
plications of these trends for mortality. Nationally, PM2.5 levels fell by 24.2% from 2009
to 2016 and then increased 5.5% from 2016 to 2018. PM2.5 increased at monitors in the
West and Midwest census regions and was ﬂat in Northeast and South census regions.
Increases occurred in counties that were in and out of attainment with National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
The paper explores channels through which the increases may have occurred, includ-
ing increases in economic activity, increases in wildﬁres, and decreases in Clean Air Act
enforcement actions. The evidence suggests that all three may have played roles in the
observed increase. Diﬀerent types of economic activity are associated with diﬀerent sub-
species of PM2.5. Trends in these subspecies are consistent with decreases in consumption
of coal, increases in consumption of natural gas, and increases in fuel consumption by
vehicles. For wildﬁres, omitting key wildﬁre months lowers the magnitude of the observed
increases in PM2.5 in the West and Midwest from 2016 to 2018. The overall pattern of
decline from 2009 to 2016 and then reversal, however, remains the same. The most fre-
quent type of EPA Clean Air Act enforcement action that results in a penalty are 113d
actions. 113d actions with penalties fell from 2009 to 2016 and continued to fall from
2016 to 2018 in both attainment and nonattainment counties.
While the causes of the increase in PM2.5 warrant further research, it is important
to note that the documented increases in PM2.5 have health consequences. From 2016
to 2018, premature deaths from PM2.5 rose by 9,700. At conventional valuations, these
deaths represent damages of $89 billion (in $2016).

Data amd Empirical Approach
Data are from the Air Quality System (AQS) database of daily monitored readings pro-
vided by United States Environmental Protection Agency (2019a). These data include
total PM2.5 and three major species of PM2.5, ammonium nitrate, sulfate, and elemental
carbon. Figure 1 shows the location of the 653 counties with monitors in our sample. The
data encompass all observations in the contiguous United States from 2009 to 2018. This
yields a dataset of over 1.8 million daily readings. NAAQS attainment status and histories
are provided by United States Environmental Protection Agency (2019c). The analysis
examines two deﬁnitions of nonattainment: nonattainment with standards relevant to
PM2.5 levels including nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and PM2.5 and nonattainment
with any criteria pollutant.
Our primary empirical speciﬁcation is:
ln(PMj,m,d,t) = αj + γm + δd + βt + ϵj,m,d,t
(1)
The dependent variable is the natural log of PM2.5 (or its subspecies). It includes pollution
monitor (j), month of year (m), day of month (d), and year (t) ﬁxed eﬀects. Standard
errors are clustered at the monitor level.

Trends in PM2.5
Figure 2 and column 1 of Table 1 show that the decline in PM2.5 pollution levels ended
in 2016 and was followed by increases in 2017 and 2018. The aggregate decline from 2009
to 2016 was 24.2%. By 2018, it had rebounded by 5.5% from its 2016 low. The annual
average PM2.5 level across all monitors in 2016 was 7.51 µg/m3. Appendix Table A.1
provides means for 2016 for outcomes in the regression tables and ﬁgures.
Figure 3 and columns 2-5 of Table 1 show that PM2.5 pollution levels in all four Census
regions stopped declining in 2016. Over 2016 to 2018, the Northeast and South census
3
regions saw no change in PM2.5, while the Midwest and West regions saw increases of
9.3% and 11.5%. The average PM2.5 levels in 2016 for the Northeast, Midwest, South,
and West were: 7.50, 7.19, 8.09, and 7.34 µg/m3. The patterns are similar in Appendix
Table A.2, which is weighted by county population in 2016.
Ambient air quality is managed under by the Clean Air Act primarily though the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Counties are classiﬁed annually as
being in or out of attainment with the NAAQS for the six criteria pollutants. In our
main speciﬁcation, we consider a county in nonattainment if it is in nonattainment for
PM2.5 or either of two precursor species, SO2 and NO2. In alternative speciﬁcations, we
consider a county in nonattainment if it is in nonattainment for any criteria pollutant.
Figure 4 and columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 show that PM2.5 began to increase after 2016
for monitors located in both attainment and nonattainment counties. The aggregate de-
cline from 2009 to 2016 was 21.7% in nonattainment counties and 23.9% in attainment
counties. Between 2016 and 2018, pollution levels increased 8.1% in nonattainment coun-
ties and 4.9% in attainment counties. The average PM2.5 levels in 2016 for nonattainment
and attainment counties were: 8.73 and 7.05 µg/m3. Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 present
results if nonattainment is deﬁned as a county that is out of attainment for any of the
criteria pollutants. The results are similar under this broader classiﬁcation.

Economic Activity, Wildﬁres, and Enforcement
This section provides evidence on three possible channels through which the recent in-
crease may have occurred: economic activity, wildﬁres, and enforcement.
4.1
Economic Activity
To shed light on economic activity, we use speciated PM2.5 data, which consists of nitrate,
sulfate, and elemental carbon. These species are useful for understanding the sources of
pollution, because diﬀerent processes emit diﬀerent types of pollutants (United States
4
Environmental Protection Agency, 1998). For example, oxides of nitrogen (precursors
to particulate nitrate) are emitted by industrial, household, and mobile sources. Sulfur
dioxide is predominantly emitted by coal-ﬁred power plants (Zhang et al., 2014). In con-
trast, natural gas-ﬁred power plants emit only trace amounts of sulfur dioxide. Elemental
carbon is emitted by diesel vehicles, coal ﬁred power plants, and other industrial sources
that utilize coal or fuel oil.
Figure 5 and Table 3 show that sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon declined steeply
from 2009 to 2016. From 2016 to 2018, sulfate continued to fall by 9.0%. In contrast,
nitrate increased by 7.4% and elemental carbon rose by 20.7%. The average levels in
2016 for sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon were: 0.76, 0.55, and 0.33µg/m3.
The chemical composition of particulates point to increased use of natural gas and to
vehicle miles traveled as likely contributors to the increase in PM2.5. Sulfate has declined,
which is consistent with the decline in coal ﬁred power generation and increasing use of
ﬂue-gas desulfurization in remaining plants. From 2009 to 2018, coal consumption by
the electricity sector fell by 31.9% (Energy Information Administration, 2019a). The
increase in nitrate is consistent with observed increases in natural gas consumption by
households, power plants, and industry. Natural gas consumption during this period grew
30.1% overall and consumption by the electricity sector rose 54.6% (Energy Information
Administration, 2019b). From 2009 to 2018, vehicle miles increased by about 10% (Federal
Highway Administration, 2019). Elemental carbon is primarily emitted when diesel fuel
oil or biomass is burned.
The pattern in Figure 5 for elemental carbon is robust to
exclusion of summer wildﬁre months. Therefore, we conclude that the eﬀect is due to
diesel vehicles, as well as some industrial boilers.
4.2
Wildﬁres
Wildﬁres are another possible cause of the increase in PM2.5. Borgschulte, Molitor and
Zou (2018) show that ﬁres frequently occur in the West and aﬀect air quality in the
Midwest. Table 4 and Appendix Table A.3 examine the possible importance of wildﬁres
5
for the West, the Midwest, and for California by omitting June to September – the main
wildﬁre season.1 We include California, because as we shall see later, it accounts for a
large share of the increase in premature mortality in both years. The last column omits
November in California, because there were two major wildﬁres in November 2018, the
Camp and Woolsey ﬁres.
The results in Table 4 and Appendix Table A.3 suggest that wildﬁres may account
for some of the observed increase in PM2.5 from 2016 to 2018, but not for the general
pattern of decline and then reversal. For example, in Table 4 over 2009-2016 when June
to September are dropped, PM2.5 at the average monitor in the West decreased 23.5%, in
the Midwest decreased 29.0%, and in California decreased 27.6%. It then increased from
2016 to 2018 by 4.9% in the West, 4.2% in the Midwest, and 12.5% in California.
4.3
Enforcement
Enforcement may inﬂuence ﬁrms’ compliance with the Clean Air Act. To explore en-
forcement, we us the EPA’s ECHO database.
The database includes many diﬀerent
types of enforcement actions, not just those pertaining to air pollution. We report trends
in enforcement actions targeting the Clean Air Act. More speciﬁcally, we focus on those
actions resulting in a penalty for violations of section 113d of the Act. These are the
most frequent type of action targeting the Clean Air Act and resulting in a penalty. Over
3,000 such measures have been reported in the ECHO database since 2009.
Figure 6 shows that 113d enforcement actions resulting in a penalty have been quite
variable over time and have fallen from 2013 to 2018. Figure 7 provides graphs for counties
by attainment status, where nonattainment refers to PM2.5, SO2, or NO2. Enforcement
actions in attainment counties are similar to the patterns in Figure 6 – a decline from
2013 on. Enforcement actions in nonattainment counties declined dramatically over time,
especially since 2012. These declines could have been driven by many factors including
increased compliance levels or changes in enforcement practices. The decline in enforce-

increases in driving or increased use of electricity for air conditioning.

ment actions, however, is concerning in light of the increases in air pollution in both
attainment and nonattainment counties after 2016.2

Implications for Mortality
To explore the public health consequences of the increase in PM2.5, we employ the dam-
age function approach used in EPA’s Beneﬁt-Cost Analyses of the Clean Air Act (United
States Environmental Protection Agency, 1999, 2010a), the Regulatory Impact Analy-
ses for PM2.5 (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2010b), and numerous
academic studies (Muller, Mendelsohn and Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014). This strategy
uses peer-reviewed epidemiological dose-response functions that link exposure to ambi-
ent PM2.5 to elevated mortality rates (Krewski et al., 2009), along with vital statistics
(population and mortality rates), by county. Further details on this calculation are in
Appendix B.
Table 5 presents the increases in annual deaths and damages from 2016 to 2017 and
from 2016 to 2018. The number of premature deaths due to PM2.5 in counties with mon-
itors increased by about 4,900 from 2016 to 2017 and 9,700 from 2016 to 2018. Valuation
of mortality risk employs the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) approach.(Viscusi and
Aldy, 2003) We employ the EPA’s preferred VSL of $7.4 million, which we then convert
to 2016 dollars (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019b) Applying the
VSL to these eﬀects produces damages of $45 billion and $89 billion.
About 80% of the burden of air pollution is borne by the elderly. While some deaths
among the elderly are shifted by days or weeks, recent research suggests that the burden
is ”concentrated among the elderly with ﬁve to ten years of remaining life expectancy,
followed by those with two to ﬁve years remaining, because these groups represent a large
2Interviews suggest that declines in federal enforcement may adversely aﬀect state enforcement (Vol-
covici, 2019). Cynthia Giles, former head of the EPA’s Oﬃce of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance,
wrote in April 2017: ”Don’t be fooled by the suggestion that if the EPA walks away, everything will still
be ﬁne because states will step to the plate and enforce the law. The EPA’s retreat will only embolden
industry and weaken states. If the EPA is not there to enforce laws, then in many cases no one will

fraction of the Medicare population and are also vulnerable to acute particulate matter
exposure (Deryugina et al., 2019).”
The ambient monitoring data suggest that PM2.5 increases were especially pronounced
in California. In 2016, the readings across the state averaged 8.06 µg/m3. This increased
to 9.68 µg/m3 in 2017, and 11.34 µg/m3 in 2018. Because of these large increases and the
large exposed population in California, we ﬁnd that nearly 43% of the increase in deaths
nationally from 2016 to 2018 occurred in California. California experienced numerous
large wildﬁres. Table 5 presents deaths for California and for California dropping June
to September. In contrast to the results for the United States, the number of deaths is
very similar whether or not June to September are included.
To further explore the inﬂuence of ﬁres, we conducted an additional exercise in which
ambient PM2.5 readings from every month in 2017 and 2018 were dropped from the annual
average PM2.5 calculations. This exercise ﬁnds that November 2018 had an outsized eﬀect
on our mortality calculations. Without this month, the change in deaths from 2017 to
2018 in California was 590 compared to over 2,000 when observations from November
2018 are included. Importantly, the disastrous Camp Fire occurred during this month.
No other month over the 2017 to 2018 time period in California has nearly as large an
impact on our mortality calculations.

Conclusion
After a long period of decline, PM2.5 in counties with monitors in the United States in-
creased by 5.5% between 2016 and 2018. Increases occurred in multiple census regions and
in counties that were in and out of attainment with National Ambient Air Quality Stan-
dards (NAAQS). We examined evidence on economic activity, wildﬁres, and enforcement.
The evidence is consistent with all three having contributed to the increase, although fur-
ther research remains to be done on the relative eﬀects of the three and on other causes.
The increase in PM2.5 was associated with 9,700 additional premature deaths in 2018.
At conventional valuations, these deaths represent damages of $89 billion. The number
8
of deaths and the damages highlight the importance of air pollution as a policy issue.

is nonattainment for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and PM2.5.
Attainment refers to attainment
for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and PM2.5. Nonattainment Any is nonattainment for any criteria
pollutant. Attainment Any is attainment for all criteria pollutant. Enforcement actions are counts of
Clean Air Act section 113d actions that result in a penalty.

B
Appendix: Calculation of Mortality
To estimate the mortality burden imposed by the increased PM2.5 levels in nonattainment
counties, the following calculations are performed. The functional form and parameter
estimate governing the link between ambient PM2.5 and mortality risk (β) are commonly
used in the literature (United States Environmental Protection Agency (1999), United
States Environmental Protection Agency (2010a)).
Deathsa,i,t = Popa,i,txMRa,i,tx(1 −1/(exp(βx(PM2.5i,t))))
(B.1)
Totals deaths are the sum of (4) across age groups and nonattainment counties. We
monetize the deaths from equation B.1 by applying the VSL uniformly across ages and
counties.
