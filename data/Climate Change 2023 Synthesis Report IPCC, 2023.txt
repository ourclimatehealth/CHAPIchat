Section 1
This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) 
summarises the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread 
impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based 
on the peer-reviewed scientiﬁc, technical and socio-economic literature 
since the publication of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 
2014.
The assessment is undertaken within the context of the evolving 
international landscape, in particular, developments in the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, 
including the outcomes of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the 
Paris Agreement. It reﬂects the increasing diversity of those involved in 
climate action. 
This report integrates the main ﬁndings of the AR6 Working Group 
reports58 and the three AR6 Special Reports59. It recognizes the 
interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human 
societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close 
linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem 
health, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on 
multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and 
social sciences, this report identiﬁes opportunities for transformative 
action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts 
of systems transitions and resilient development pathways60. Different 
regional classiﬁcation schemes61 are used for physical, social and 
economic aspects, reﬂecting the underlying literature.
After this introduction, Section 2, ‘Current Status and Trends’, opens 
with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing 
climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate 
change, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of 
adaptation and mitigation response options. Section 3, ‘Long-Term 
Climate and Development Futures’, provides a long-term assessment of 
climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic 
58 
The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Climate 
Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, respectively. Their assessments cover scientiﬁc literature accepted for publication respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 
2021 and 11 October 2021.
59 
The three Special Reports are : Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related 
global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate 
poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertiﬁcation, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and 
greenhouse gas ﬂuxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientiﬁc literature 
accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 15 May 2019.
60 
The Glossary (Annex I) includes deﬁnitions of these, and other terms and concepts used in this report drawn from the AR6 joint Working Group Glossary.
61 
Depending on the climate information context, geographical regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and oceanic regions, or to typological regions, such 
as monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities. A new set of standard AR6 WGI reference land and ocean regions have been deﬁned. WGIII allocates countries to 
geographical regions, based on the UN Statistics Division Classiﬁcation {WGI 1.4.5, WGI 10.1, WGI 11.9, WGI 12.1–12.4, WGI Atlas.1.3.3–1.3.4}.
62 
Each ﬁnding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high and very 
high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium conﬁdence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result: virtually certain 
99–100% probability; very likely 90–100%; likely 66–100%; more likely than not >50-100%; about as likely as not 33–66%; unlikely 0–33%; very unlikely 0–10%; and 
exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%  and extremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood also is typeset in 
italics: for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5. In this Report, unless stated otherwise, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 
90% interval.
futures. It considers long-term characteristics, impacts, risks and costs 
in adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable 
development. Section 4, ‘Near- Term Responses in a Changing Climate’, 
assesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period up 
to 2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the 
pursuit of sustainable development.
Based on scientiﬁc understanding, key ﬁndings can be formulated as 
statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of conﬁdence 
using the IPCC calibrated language62. The scientiﬁc ﬁndings are 
drawn from the underlying reports and arise from their Summary for 
Policymakers (hereafter SPM), Technical Summary (hereafter TS), and 
underlying chapters and are indicated by {} brackets. Figure 1.1 shows

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over 
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WGI SPM footnote 11}
67 
Contributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; methane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; 
nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and ﬂuorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C.
68 
For 2021 (the most recent year for which ﬁnal numbers are available) concentrations using the same observational products and methods as in AR6 WGI are: 415 ppm CO2; 
1896 ppb CH4; and 335 ppb N2O. Note that the CO2 is reported here using the WMO-CO2-X2007 scale to be consistent with WGI. Operational CO2 reporting has since been 
updated to use the WMO-CO2-X2019 scale.
the past six decades, with regional differences (high conﬁdence). In 2019, 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million (ppm), CH4 
reached 1866 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) reached 332 ppb68. 
Other major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone (O3) and 
halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH4 and N2O have increased to 
levels unprecedented in at least 800,000 years (very high conﬁdence), 
and there is high conﬁdence that current CO2 concentrations are 
higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 
1750, increases in CO2 (47%) and CH4 (156%) concentrations far 
exceed – and increases in N2O (23%) are similar to – the natural 
multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at 
least the past 800,000 years (very high conﬁdence). The net cooling effect 
which arises from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century 
(high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM A1.1, WGI SPM A1.3, WGI SPM A.2.1,

Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting 
warming of the climate system. Emissions of GHG have 
increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net 
anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel 
combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); 
net CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF) 
(green); CH4; N2O; and ﬂuorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) 
(light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric 
concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed 
GHGs CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their 
relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and 
N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, 
in the case of CH4 indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts 
on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature 
change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. This estimate arises from 
an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. 
The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from 
a 1850–1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 
1850–1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the 
estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest 
multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which 
occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial 
period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period 
was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century 
temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of 
the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused 
by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and 
attribution studies synthesise information from climate models 
and observations and show that the best estimate is that all the 
warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused 
by humans (panel (d)). The panel shows temperature change 
attributed to: total human inﬂuence; its decomposition into changes 
in GHG concentrations and other human drivers (aerosols, ozone 
and land-use change (land-use reﬂectance)); solar and volcanic 
drivers; and internal climate variability. Whiskers show likely ranges.

Section 1
Section 2
Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher 
than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 
2010 and 2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 
and 2009 (2.1% yr-1)69. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 
1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) 
occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% 
between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic 
GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, 
about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) 
higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions 
occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by 
CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated 
gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. (high confidence) 
{WGIII SPM B1.1, WGIII SPM B.1.2, WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Figure SPM.1, 
WGIII Figure SPM.2}
Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions 
continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions 
vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also 
in terms of contributions to CO2-FFI (1650 ± 73 GtCO2-eq) and net 
CO2-LULUCF (760 ± 220 GtCO2-eq) emissions (Figure 2.2). Variations 
in regional and national per capita emissions partly reﬂect different 
development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income 
levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 
ranged from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions (Figure 2.2). 
Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) 
have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, 
respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding 
CO2-LULUCF
. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries 
emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 35% of the global 
population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita70 
(excluding CO2-LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less 
than 3 tCO2-eq per capita. A substantial share of the population in these 
low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. (high conﬁdence)
{WGIII SPM B.3, WGIII SPM B3.1, WGIII SPM B.3.2, WGIII SPM B.3.3}
Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major 
sectors (high conﬁdence). In 2019, approximately 34% (20 GtCO2-eq) 
of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% 
(14 GtCO2-eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% 
(8.7 GtCO2-eq) from transport and 6% (3.3 GtCO2-eq) from buildings71 
(high conﬁdence). Average annual GHG emissions growth between

GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different GHGs in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) using 
the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports 
contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and assess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of 
metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate 
system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {WGI SPM D.1.8, WGI 7.6; WGIII SPM B.1, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 2.2} (Annex I: Glossary)

GHG emission levels are rounded to two signiﬁcant digits; as a consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur. {WGIII SPM footnote 8}

Comprising a gross sink of -12.5 (±3.2) GtCO2 yr-1 resulting from responses of all land to both anthropogenic environmental change and natural climate variability, and 
net anthropogenic CO2-LULUCF emissions +5.9 (±4.1) GtCO2 yr-1 based on book-keeping models. {WGIII SPM Footnote 14}
73 
This estimate is based on consumption-based accounting, including both direct emissions from within urban areas, and indirect emissions from outside urban areas related to 
the production of electricity, goods and services consumed in cities. These estimates include all CO2 and CH4 emission categories except for aviation and marine bunker fuels, 
land-use change, forestry and agriculture. {WGIII SPM footnote 15}
2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy 
supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%) but 
remained roughly constant at about 2% yr–1 in the transport sector 
(high conﬁdence). About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from 
CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation (medium conﬁdence). 
Land overall constituted a net sink of –6.6 (±4.6) GtCO2 yr–1 for the period 
2010–201972 (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.2, WGIII SPM B.2.1, 
WGIII SPM B.2.2, WGIII TS 5.6.1} 
Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than 
a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and 
land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and 
production. Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial 
processes (CO2-FFI), due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP 
and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases 
from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, 
agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households with the highest per 
capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global consumption-based 
household GHG emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40–53%, 
and the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. An increasing share of 
emissions can be attributed to urban areas (a rise from about 62% 
to 67–72% of the global share between 2015 and 2020). The drivers 
of urban GHG emissions73 are complex and include population size, 
income, state of urbanisation and urban form. (high conﬁdence)

Figure 2.2: Regional GHG emissions, and the regional proportion of total cumulative production-based CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019. Panel (a) shows the 
share of historical cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions per region from 1850 to 2019 in GtCO2. This includes CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF. Other GHG emissions are not included. 
CO2-LULUCF emissions are subject to high uncertainties, reﬂected by a global uncertainty estimate of ±70% (90% conﬁdence interval). Panel (b) shows the distribution of regional 
GHG emissions in tonnes CO2-eq per capita by region in 2019. GHG emissions are categorised into: CO2-FFI; net CO2-LULUCF; and other GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, ﬂuorinated gases, 
expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles 
refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF is below the 
axis, indicating net CO2 removals rather than emissions. Panel (c) shows global net anthropogenic GHG emissions by region (in GtCO2-eq yr–1 (GWP100-AR6)) for the time period 
1990–2019. Percentage values refer to the contribution of each region to total GHG emissions in each respective time period. The single-year peak of emissions in 1997 was due to 
higher CO2-LULUCF emissions from a forest and peat ﬁre event in South East Asia. Regions are as grouped in Annex II of WGIII. Panel (d) shows population, gross domestic product 
(GDP) per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for total GHG per person, and total GHG emissions intensity, together with production-based and consumption-based CO2-FFI data, 
which is assessed in this report up to 2018. Consumption-based emissions are emissions released to the atmosphere in order to generate the goods and services consumed by a 
certain entity (e.g., region). Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. {WGIII Figure SPM.2}
2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to 
Date
It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in 
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 
(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as 
a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system 
are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It 
is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric 
warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 
and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 
(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that 
human inﬂuence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 
91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss 
and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, 
respectively (high conﬁdence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level 
rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 
1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing 
to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high conﬁdence). 
Human inﬂuence was very likely the main driver of these increases 
since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human inﬂuence is very likely the main 
driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease 
in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human 
inﬂuence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is 
virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver 
of current global acidiﬁcation of the surface open ocean. {WGI SPM A.1, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, 
WGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2}
Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and 
climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed 
changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, 
and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human 
inﬂuence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3). It is virtually certain 
that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and 
more intense across most land regions since the 1950s (Figure 2.3), while cold 
extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, 
with high conﬁdence that human-caused climate change is the main 
driver of these changes. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled 
74 
‘Main driver’ means responsible for more than 50% of the change. {WGI SPM footnote 12}

See Annex I: Glossary.
in frequency since the 1980s (high conﬁdence), and human inﬂuence 
has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006. The 
frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased 
since the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data 
are sufﬁcient for trend analysis (high conﬁdence), and human-caused 
climate change is likely the main driver (Figure 2.3). Human-caused 
climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological 
droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration 
(medium conﬁdence) (Figure 2.3). It is likely that the global proportion 
of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over 
the last four decades. {WGI SPM A.3, WGI SPM A3.1, WGI SPM A3.2; 
WGI SPM A3.4; SRCCL SPM.A.2.2; SROCC SPM. A.2}
Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly 
irreversible75 losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, cryospheric and 
coastal and open ocean ecosystems (high conﬁdence). The extent 
and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger than estimated 
in previous assessments (high conﬁdence). Approximately half of the 
species assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to 
higher elevations (very high conﬁdence). Biological responses including 
changes in geographic placement and shifting seasonal timing are often 
not sufﬁcient to cope with recent climate change (very high conﬁdence). 
Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in 
the magnitude of heat extremes (high conﬁdence) and mass mortality 
events on land and in the ocean (very high conﬁdence). Impacts on 
some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts 
of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the 
changes in some mountain (medium conﬁdence) and Arctic ecosystems 
driven by permafrost thaw (high conﬁdence). Impacts in ecosystems 
from slow-onset processes such as ocean acidiﬁcation, sea level rise 
or regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed to 
human-caused climate change (high conﬁdence). Climate change 
has contributed to desertiﬁcation and exacerbated land degradation, 
particularly in low lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in 
permafrost areas (high conﬁdence). Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands 
have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined 
effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming 
and extreme climate events (high confidence). {WGII SPM B.1.1, 
WGII SPM B.1.2, WGII Figure SPM.2.A, WGII TS.B.1; SRCCL SPM A.1.5,

Section 1
Section 2
Climate change has reduced food security and affected water 
security due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, 
reduction and loss of cryospheric elements, and greater frequency 
and intensity of climatic extremes, thereby hindering efforts to 
meet Sustainable Development Goals (high conﬁdence). Although 
overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change has slowed 
this growth in agricultural productivity over the past 50 years globally 
(medium conﬁdence), with related negative crop yield impacts mainly 
recorded in mid- and low latitude regions, and some positive impacts 
in some high latitude regions (high conﬁdence). Ocean warming in 
the 20th century and beyond has contributed to an overall decrease 
in maximum catch potential (medium conﬁdence), compounding the 
impacts from overﬁshing for some ﬁsh stocks (high conﬁdence). Ocean 
warming and ocean acidiﬁcation have adversely affected food production 
from shellﬁsh aquaculture and ﬁsheries in some oceanic regions (high 
conﬁdence). Current levels of global warming are associated with 
moderate risks from increased dryland water scarcity (high conﬁdence). 
Roughly half of the world’s population currently experiences severe water 
scarcity for at least some part of the year due to a combination of climatic 
and non-climatic drivers (medium conﬁdence) (Figure 2.3). Unsustainable 
agricultural expansion, driven in part by unbalanced diets77, increases 
ecosystem and human vulnerability and leads to competition for land 
and/or water resources (high conﬁdence). Increasing weather and climate 
extreme events have exposed millions of people to acute food insecurity78 
and reduced water security, with the largest impacts observed in many 
locations and/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, 
LDCs, Small Islands and the Arctic, and for small-scale food producers, 
low-income households and Indigenous Peoples globally (high conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM B.1.3, WGII SPM.B.2.3, WGII Figure SPM.2, WGII TS B.2.3, 
WGII TS Figure TS. 6; SRCCL SPM A.2.8, SRCCL SPM A.5.3; SROCC SPM A.5.4., 
SROCC SPM A.7.1, SROCC SPM A.8.1, SROCC Figure SPM.2} 
77 
Balanced diets feature plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-source foods produced in resilient, 
sustainable and low-GHG emissions systems, as described in SRCCL. {WGII SPM Footnote 32}
78 
Acute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result of shocks risking 
determinants of food security and nutrition, and is used to assess the need for humanitarian action. {WGII SPM, footnote 30}
79 
Slow-onset events are described among the climatic-impact drivers of the AR6 WGI and refer to the risks and impacts associated with e.g., increasing temperature means, 
desertiﬁcation, decreasing precipitation, loss of biodiversity, land and forest degradation, glacial retreat and related impacts, ocean acidiﬁcation, sea level rise and salinization. 
{WGII SPM footnote 29}
In urban settings, climate change has caused adverse impacts on 
human health, livelihoods and key infrastructure (high conﬁdence). 
Hot extremes including heatwaves have intensiﬁed in cities (high 
conﬁdence), where they have also worsened air pollution events 
(medium conﬁdence) and limited functioning of key infrastructure 
(high conﬁdence). Urban infrastructure, including transportation, water, 
sanitation and energy systems have been compromised by extreme 
and slow-onset events79, with resulting economic losses, disruptions of 
services and impacts to well-being (high conﬁdence). Observed impacts 
are concentrated amongst economically and socially marginalised urban 
residents, e.g., those living in informal settlements (high conﬁdence). 
Cities intensify human-caused warming locally (very high conﬁdence), 
while urbanisation also increases mean and heavy precipitation over and/or 
downwind of cities (medium conﬁdence) and resulting runoff intensity 
(high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM C.2.6; WGII SPM B.1.5, WGII Figure TS.9, 
WGII 6 ES}
Climate change has adversely affected human physical health globally 
and mental health in assessed regions (very high conﬁdence), and is 
contributing to humanitarian crises where climate hazards interact 
with high vulnerability (high conﬁdence). In all regions increases in 
extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity 
(very high conﬁdence). The occurrence of climate-related food-borne and 
water-borne diseases has increased (very high conﬁdence). The incidence 
of vector-borne diseases has increased from range expansion and/or 
increased reproduction of disease vectors (high conﬁdence). Animal and 
human diseases, including zoonoses, are emerging in new areas (high 
conﬁdence). In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are 
associated with increasing temperatures (high conﬁdence), trauma from 
extreme events (very high conﬁdence), and loss of livelihoods and culture 
Figure 2.3: Both vulnerability to current climate extremes and historical contribution to climate change are highly heterogeneous with many of those who have 
least contributed to climate change to date being most vulnerable to its impacts. Panel (a) The IPCC AR6 WGI inhabited regions are displayed as hexagons with identical size 
in their approximate geographical location (see legend for regional acronyms). All assessments are made for each region as a whole and for the 1950s to the present. Assessments made 
on different time scales or more local spatial scales might differ from what is shown in the ﬁgure. The colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on observed 
changes. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole, and grey hexagons are used when there is limited 
data and/or literature that prevents an assessment of the region as a whole. Other colours indicate at least medium conﬁdence in the observed change. The conﬁdence level for the human 
inﬂuence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend detection and attribution and event attribution literature, and it is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for 
high conﬁdence, two dots for medium conﬁdence and one dot for low conﬁdence (single, ﬁlled dot: limited agreement; single, empty dot: limited evidence). For hot extremes, the evidence 
is mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on daily maximum temperatures; regional studies using other indices (heatwave duration, frequency and intensity) are used in addition. For 
heavy precipitation, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in indices based on one-day or ﬁve-day precipitation amounts using global and regional studies. Agricultural and 
ecological droughts are assessed based on observed and simulated changes in total column soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water 
balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and indices driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand. Panel (b) shows the average level of vulnerability amongst a 
country’s population against 2019 CO2-FFI emissions per- capita per country for the 180 countries for which both sets of metrics are available. Vulnerability information is based on two 
global indicator systems, namely INFORM and World Risk Index. Countries with a relatively low average vulnerability often have groups with high vulnerability within their population and 
vice versa. The underlying data includes, for example, information on poverty, inequality, health care infrastructure or insurance coverage. Panel (c) Observed impacts on ecosystems 
and human systems attributed to climate change at global and regional scales. Global assessments focus on large studies, multi-species, meta-analyses and large reviews. Regional 
assessments consider evidence on impacts across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. For human systems, the direction of impacts is assessed and both 
adverse and positive impacts have been observed e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item (for more details and 
methodology see WGII SMTS.1).  Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and demand for water. 
Global mental health and displacement assessments reﬂect only assessed regions. Conﬁdence levels reﬂect the assessment of attribution of the observed impact to climate change.

Section 2
(high conﬁdence) (Figure 2.3). Climate change impacts on health are 
mediated through natural and human systems, including economic 
and social conditions and disruptions (high conﬁdence). Climate and 
weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in Africa, 
Asia, North America (high conﬁdence), and Central and South America 
(medium conﬁdence) (Figure 2.3), with small island states in the 
Caribbean and South Paciﬁc being disproportionately affected relative 
to their small population size (high conﬁdence). Through displacement 
and involuntary migration from extreme weather and climate 
events, climate change has generated and perpetuated vulnerability 
(medium conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.1.4, WGII SPM B.1.7}
Human inﬂuence has likely increased the chance of compound 
extreme events80 since the 1950s. Concurrent and repeated climate 
hazards have occurred in all regions, increasing impacts and 
risks to health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods and food 
(high conﬁdence). Compound extreme events include increases in the 
frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts (high conﬁdence); ﬁre 
weather in some regions (medium conﬁdence); and compound ﬂooding in 
some locations (medium conﬁdence). Multiple risks interact, generating 
new sources of vulnerability to climate hazards, and compounding 
overall risk (high conﬁdence). Compound climate hazards can overwhelm 
adaptive capacity and substantially increase damage (high conﬁdence)).

Economic 
impacts 
attributable 
to 
climate 
change 
are 
increasingly 
affecting peoples’ livelihoods and are causing economic and 
societal impacts across national boundaries (high conﬁdence). 
Economic damages from climate change have been detected in 
climate-exposed sectors, with regional effects to agriculture, forestry, 
ﬁshery, energy, and tourism, and through outdoor labour productivity 
(high conﬁdence) with some exceptions of positive impacts in regions 
with low energy demand and comparative advantages in agricultural 
markets and tourism (high conﬁdence). Individual livelihoods have been 
affected through changes in agricultural productivity, impacts on human 
health and food security, destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss 
of property and income, with adverse effects on gender and social equity 
(high conﬁdence). Tropical cyclones have reduced economic growth in 
the short-term (high conﬁdence). Event attribution studies and physical 
understanding indicate that human-caused climate change increases 
heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones (high conﬁdence). 
Wildﬁres in many regions have affected built assets, economic activity, 
and health (medium to high conﬁdence). In cities and settlements, climate 
impacts to key infrastructure are leading to losses and damages across water 
and food systems, and affect economic activity, with impacts extending 
beyond the area directly impacted by the climate hazard (high conﬁdence).

the associated norms, rules, laws and procedures for deciding, managing, implementing and monitoring policies and measures at any geographic or political scale, from global 
to local. {WGII SPM Footnote 31}
to tangible and intangible heritage, threaten adaptive capacity and may 
result in irrevocable losses of sense of belonging, valued cultural practices, 
identity and home, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and those more 
directly reliant on the environment for subsistence (medium conﬁdence). 
For example, changes in snow cover, lake and river ice, and permafrost 
in many Arctic regions, are harming the livelihoods and cultural identity 
of Arctic residents including Indigenous populations (high conﬁdence). 
Infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation and energy 
systems have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset events, 
with resulting economic losses, disruptions of services and impacts 
to well-being (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.1, WGII SPM B.1.2, 
WGII SPM.B.1.5, WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII TS.B.1.6; SROCC SPM A.7.1}
Across sectors and regions, the most vulnerable people and 
systems have been disproportionately affected by the impacts 
of climate change (high conﬁdence). LDCs and SIDS who have much 
lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq, 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than 
the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq) excluding CO2-LULUCF, also have high 
vulnerability to climatic hazards, with global hotspots of high human 
vulnerability observed in West-, Central- and East Africa, South Asia, 
Central and South America, SIDS and the Arctic (high conﬁdence). 
Regions and people with considerable development constraints have 
high vulnerability to climatic hazards (high conﬁdence). Vulnerability is 
higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited 
access to basic services and resources, violent conﬂict and high levels 
of climate-sensitive livelihoods (e.g., smallholder farmers, pastoralists, 
ﬁshing communities) (high conﬁdence). Vulnerability at different spatial 
levels is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, 
ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof (high conﬁdence), especially 
for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities (high conﬁdence). 
Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly 
vulnerable to climate change (high conﬁdence). Between 2010 and 
2020, human mortality from ﬂoods, droughts and storms was 15 times 
higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low 
vulnerability (high conﬁdence). In the Arctic and in some high mountain 
regions, negative impacts of cryosphere change have been especially felt 
among Indigenous Peoples (high conﬁdence). Human and ecosystem 
vulnerability are interdependent (high conﬁdence). Vulnerability of 
ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and 
within regions (very high conﬁdence), driven by patterns of intersecting 
socio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, 
inequity, marginalisation, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity 
such as colonialism, and governance81 (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.1,

International climate agreements, rising national ambitions for climate action, along with rising public awareness 
are accelerating efforts to address climate change at multiple levels of governance. Mitigation policies have 
contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity, with several countries achieving GHG emission 
reductions for over a decade. Low-emission technologies are becoming more affordable, with many low or 
zero emissions options now available for energy, buildings, transport, and industry. Adaptation planning and 
implementation progress has generated multiple beneﬁts, with effective adaptation options having the potential 
to reduce climate risks and contribute to sustainable development. Global tracked ﬁnance for mitigation and 
adaptation has seen an upward trend since AR5, but falls short of needs. (high conﬁdence)
2.2.1. Global Policy Setting 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 
Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement are supporting rising levels of 
national ambition and encouraging the development and implementation 
of climate policies at multiple levels of governance (high conﬁdence). 
The Kyoto Protocol led to reduced emissions in some countries and 
was instrumental in building national and international capacity 
for GHG reporting, accounting and emissions markets (high 
confidence). The Paris Agreement, adopted under the UNFCCC, with 
near universal participation, has led to policy development and 
target-setting at national and sub-national levels, particularly in 
relation to mitigation but also for adaptation, as well as enhanced 
transparency of climate action and support (medium confidence). 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), required under 
the Paris Agreement, have required countries to articulate their 
priorities and ambition with respect to climate action. {WGII 17.4, 
WGII TS D.1.1; WGIII SPM B.5.1, WGIII SPM E.6}
Loss & Damage82 was formally recognized in 2013 through establishment 
of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM), 
and in 2015, Article 8 of the Paris Agreement provided a legal basis 
for the WIM. There is improved understanding of both economic and 
non-economic losses and damages, which is informing international 
climate policy and which has highlighted that losses and damages are 
not comprehensively addressed by current ﬁnancial, governance and 
institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII Cross-Chapter Box LOSS}
Other recent global agreements that inﬂuence responses to climate 
change include the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
(2015-2030), the ﬁnance-oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda (2015) 
and the New Urban Agenda (2016), and the Kigali Amendment to 
the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer 
(2016), among others. In addition, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, adopted in 2015 by UN member states, sets out 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and seeks to align efforts 
globally to prioritise ending extreme poverty, protect the planet and 
promote more peaceful, prosperous and inclusive societies. If achieved, 
these agreements would reduce climate change, and the impacts on 
health, well-being, migration, and conﬂict, among others (very high 
conﬁdence). {WGII TS.A.1, WGII 7 ES} 
Since AR5, rising public awareness and an increasing diversity 
of actors, have overall helped accelerate political commitment 
and global efforts to address climate change (medium

conﬁdence). Mass social movements have emerged as catalysing 
agents in some regions, often building on prior movements including 
Indigenous Peoples-led movements, youth movements, human 
rights movements, gender activism, and climate litigation, which is 
raising awareness and, in some cases, has inﬂuenced the outcome 
and ambition of climate governance (medium conﬁdence). Engaging 
Indigenous Peoples and local communities using just-transition and 
rights-based decision-making approaches, implemented through 
collective and participatory decision-making processes has enabled 
deeper ambition and accelerated action in different ways, and at all 
scales, depending on national circumstances (medium conﬁdence). 
The media helps shape the public discourse about climate change. This 
can usefully build public support to accelerate climate action (medium 
evidence, high agreement). In some instances, public discourses of 
media and organised counter movements have impeded climate 
action, exacerbating helplessness and disinformation and fuelling 
polarisation, with negative implications for climate action (medium 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.5.1, WGII SPM D.2, WGII TS.D.9, WGII TS.D.9.7, 
WGII TS.E.2.1, WGII 18.4; WGIII SPM D.3.3, WGIII SPM E.3.3, WGIII TS.6.1, 
WGIII 6.7, WGIII 13 ES, WGIII Box.13.7}
2.2.2. Mitigation Actions to Date
There has been a consistent expansion of policies and laws 
addressing mitigation since AR5 (high conﬁdence). Climate 
governance supports mitigation by providing frameworks through 
which diverse actors interact, and a basis for policy development and 
implementation (medium conﬁdence). Many regulatory and economic 
instruments have already been deployed successfully (high conﬁdence). 
By 2020, laws primarily focussed on reducing GHG emissions existed in 
56 countries covering 53% of global emissions (medium conﬁdence). 
The application of diverse policy instruments for mitigation at the 
national and sub-national levels has grown consistently across a 
range of sectors (high conﬁdence). Policy coverage is uneven across 
sectors and remains limited for emissions from agriculture, and from 
industrial materials and feedstocks (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.5, 
WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM E.3, WGIII SPM E.4}
Practical experience has informed economic instrument design 
and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, 
economic efﬁciency, alignment with distributional goals, and social 
acceptance (high conﬁdence). Low-emission technological innovation 
is strengthened through the combination of technology-push policies, 
together with policies that create incentives for behaviour change and 
market opportunities (high conﬁdence) (Section 4.8.3). Comprehensive 
and consistent policy packages have been found to be more effective 
2.2 Responses Undertaken to Date
53
Current Status and Trends
Section 2
than single policies (high conﬁdence). Combining mitigation with 
policies to shift development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or 
behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting walkable urban 
areas combined with electriﬁcation and renewable energy can create 
health co-beneﬁts from cleaner air and enhanced active mobility (high 
conﬁdence). Climate governance enables mitigation by providing an 
overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across 
policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the 
context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances 
regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the 
context to mobilise ﬁnance (medium conﬁdence). These functions can 
be promoted by climate-relevant laws, which are growing in number, or 
climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national 
context (medium conﬁdence). Effective and equitable climate 
governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political 
actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local 
communities (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM E.2.2, WGIII SPM E.3, 
WGIII SPM E.3.1, WGIII SPM E.4.2, WGIII SPM E.4.3, WGIII SPM E.4.4}
The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including 
solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently 
since 2010 (Figure 2.4). Design and process innovations in 
combination with the use of digital technologies have led to 
near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions 
options in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010-2019, 
there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy 
(by 85%), wind energy (by 55%), and lithium-ion batteries (by 85%), 
and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for 
electric vehicles (EVs), albeit varying widely across regions (Figure 2.4). 
Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from 
fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly 
competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale 
battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In 
comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical 
record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with 
fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions 
and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive 
systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than 
transitioning to low emission systems. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM B.4, 
WGIII SPM B.4.1, WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII SPM C.5.2, WGIII SPM C.7.2, 
WGIII SPM C.8, WGIII Figure SPM.3, WGIII Figure SPM.3}
For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and 
chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG intensity production processes are 
at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage 
but they are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design 
in construction and retroﬁt of buildings has led to increasing examples 
of zero energy or zero carbon buildings. Technological innovation 
made possible the widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital 
technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, and 
artiﬁcial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; 
they can increase energy efﬁciency, and promote the adoption of many 
low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, 
while creating economic opportunities. However, some of these climate 
change mitigation gains can be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in 
demand for goods and services due to the use of digital devices. Several 
mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electriﬁcation of 
urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efﬁciency, demand 
side management, improved forest- and crop/grassland management, 
and reduced food waste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming 
increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the public, and 
this enables expanded deployment in many regions. (high conﬁdence) 
{WGIII SPM B.4.3, WGIII SPM C.5.2, WGIII SPM C.7.2, WGIII SPM E.1.1, 
WGIII TS.6.5}
The magnitude of global climate ﬁnance ﬂows has increased 
and ﬁnancing channels have broadened (high conﬁdence). 
Annual tracked total ﬁnancial ﬂows for climate mitigation and 
adaptation increased by up to 60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20, 
but average growth has slowed since 2018 (medium conﬁdence) and 
most climate ﬁnance stays within national borders (high conﬁdence). 
Markets for green bonds, environmental, social and governance and 
sustainable ﬁnance products have expanded signiﬁcantly since AR5 
(high conﬁdence). Investors, central banks, and ﬁnancial regulators are 
driving increased awareness of climate risk to support climate policy 
development and implementation (high conﬁdence). Accelerated 
international ﬁnancial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and 
just transitions (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.5, 
WGIII TS.6.3, WGIII TS.6.4}
Economic instruments have been effective in reducing emissions, 
complemented by regulatory instruments mainly at the national 
and also sub-national and regional level (high conﬁdence). By 2020, 
over 20% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or 
emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices have been 
insufﬁcient to achieve deep reductions (medium conﬁdence). Equity and 
distributional impacts of carbon pricing instruments can be addressed 
by using revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading to support 
low-income households, among other approaches (high conﬁdence). 
The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated 
adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries 
includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and 
demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale 
(high conﬁdence) (Figure 2.4). {WGIII SPM B.4.1, WGIII SPM B.5.2, 
WGIII SPM E.4.2, WG III TS.3} 
Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed 
to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 
2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving 
absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade (high 
conﬁdence). While global net GHG emissions have increased since 
2010, global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) 
decreased by 2% yr–1 between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon 
intensity (CO2-FFI per unit primary energy) also decreased by 0.3% 
yr–1, mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion 
of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large 
regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies 
have enhanced energy efﬁciency, reduced rates of deforestation and 
accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some 
cases reduced or removed emissions (high conﬁdence). At least 
18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 and GHG and 
consumption-based CO2 absolute emission reductions for longer than 
10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy 
efﬁciency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from 
both policies and changes in economic structure (high conﬁdence). 
Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a 
third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates 
of around 4% yr–1 for several years consecutively (high conﬁdence). 
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to 
avoided global emissions of several GtCO2-eq yr–1 (medium conﬁdence).

Fossil fuel cost (2020)
below this point, costs can 
be less than fossil fuels
Figure 2.4: Unit cost reductions and use in some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. The top panel (a) shows global costs per unit of energy (USD per MWh) 
for some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. Solid blue lines indicate average unit cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas show the range between the 5th and 95th 
percentiles in each year. Yellow shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020 (corresponding to USD 55 to 148 per MWh). 
In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the three renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, costs shown are for 1 kWh 
of battery storage capacity; for the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced. The literature uses 
LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made. However, it does not include the costs of grid integration 
or climate impacts. Further, LCOE does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall (monetary and non-monetary) costs of 
technologies and alter their deployment. The bottom panel (b) shows cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW of installed capacity for renewable energy and 
in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles. A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to indicate the change over the past decade. The electricity production share reﬂects 
different capacity factors; for example, for the same amount of installed capacity, wind produces about twice as much electricity as solar PV. Renewable energy and battery 
technologies were selected as illustrative examples because they have recently shown rapid changes in costs and adoption, and because consistent data are available. Other 
mitigation options assessed in the WGIII report are not included as they do not meet these criteria. {WGIII Figure SPM.3, WGIII 2.5, 6.4}

Current Status and Trends
Section 2
At least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided emissions can be accounted for 
by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and 
regulatory instruments (medium conﬁdence). Growing numbers of 
laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and are 
estimated to have resulted in 5.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided emissions 
in 2016 (medium conﬁdence). These reductions have only partly offset 
global emissions growth (high confidence). {WGIII SPM B.1,

WGIII 1.3.2, WGIII 2.2.3}
2.2.3. Adaptation Actions to Date
Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been 
observed across all sectors and regions, generating multiple 
beneﬁts (very high conﬁdence). The ambition, scope and progress 
on adaptation have risen among governments at the local, national and 
international levels, along with businesses, communities and civil society 
(high conﬁdence). Various tools, measures and processes are available 
that can enable, accelerate and sustain adaptation implementation 
(high conﬁdence). Growing public and political awareness of climate 
impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities 
including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes 
(high conﬁdence). Decision support tools and climate services are 
increasingly being used (very high conﬁdence) and pilot projects and 
local experiments are being implemented in different sectors (high 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.1, WGII SPM.C.1.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.10}
Adaptation to water-related risks and impacts make up the majority (~60%) 
of all documented83 adaptation (high conﬁdence). A large number of 
these adaptation responses are in the agriculture sector and these 
include on-farm water management, water storage, soil moisture 
conservation, and irrigation. Other adaptations in agriculture include 
cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation and 
farm and landscape diversiﬁcation among others (high conﬁdence). 
For inland ﬂooding, combinations of non-structural measures like 
early warning systems, enhancing natural water retention such as by 
restoring wetlands and rivers, and land use planning such as no build 
zones or upstream forest management, can reduce ﬂood risk (medium 
conﬁdence). Some land-related adaptation actions such as sustainable 
food production, improved and sustainable forest management, 
soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land 
restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced 
food loss and waste are being undertaken, and can have mitigation 
co-beneﬁts (high conﬁdence). Adaptation actions that increase the 
resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change 
include responses like minimising additional stresses or disturbances, 
reducing fragmentation, increasing natural habitat extent, connectivity 
and heterogeneity, and protecting small-scale refugia where 
microclimate conditions can allow species to persist (high conﬁdence). 
Most innovations in urban adaptation have occurred through advances

Documented adaptation refers to published literature on adaptation policies, measures and actions that has been implemented and documented in peer reviewed literature, as 
opposed to adaptation that may have been planned, but not implemented.

 See Annex I: Glossary.

Irrigation is effective in reducing drought risk and climate impacts in many regions and has several livelihood beneﬁts, but needs appropriate management to avoid potential 
adverse outcomes, which can include accelerated depletion of groundwater and other water sources and increased soil salinization (medium conﬁdence).

EbA is recognised internationally under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD14/5). A related concept is Nature-based Solutions (NbS), see Annex I: Glossary.
in disaster risk management, social safety nets and green/blue 
infrastructure (medium conﬁdence). Many adaptation measures that 
beneﬁt health and well-being are found in other sectors (e.g., food, 
livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation, infrastructure) 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2, WGII TS.D.1.2, 
WGII TS.D.1.4, WGII TS.D.4.2, WGII TS.D.8.3, WGII 4 ES; SRCCL SPM B.1.1}
Adaptation can generate multiple additional beneﬁts such as improving 
agricultural productivity, innovation, health and well-being, food 
security, livelihood, and biodiversity conservation as well as reduction 
of risks and damages (very high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C1.1} 
Globally tracked adaptation ﬁnance has shown an upward trend 
since AR5, but represents only a small portion of total climate 
ﬁnance, is uneven and has developed heterogeneously across 
regions and sectors (high conﬁdence). Adaptation ﬁnance has come 
predominantly from public sources, largely through grants, concessional 
and non-concessional instruments (very high conﬁdence). Globally, 
private-sector ﬁnancing of adaptation from a variety of sources such 
as commercial ﬁnancial institutions, institutional investors, other 
private equity, non-ﬁnancial corporations, as well as communities 
and households has been limited, especially in developing countries 
(high conﬁdence). Public mechanisms and ﬁnance can leverage 
private sector ﬁnance for adaptation by addressing real and perceived 
regulatory, cost and market barriers, for example via public-private 
partnerships (high conﬁdence). Innovations in adaptation and 
resilience ﬁnance, such as forecast-based/anticipatory ﬁnancing 
systems and regional risk insurance pools, have been piloted and are 
growing in scale (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4; 
WGII TS.D.1.6, WGII Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE; WGIII SPM E.5.4}
There are adaptation options which are effective84 in reducing 
climate risks85 for speciﬁc contexts, sectors and regions and 
contribute positively to sustainable development and other 
societal goals. In the agriculture sector, cultivar improvements, 
on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, 
irrigation86, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, and farm and 
landscape level diversiﬁcation, and sustainable land management 
approaches, provide multiple beneﬁts and reduce climate risks. 
Reduction of food loss and waste, and adaptation measures in support 
of balanced diets contribute to nutrition, health, and biodiversity beneﬁts. 
(high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2; 
SRCCL B.2, SRCCL SPM C.2.1}
Ecosystem-based Adaptation87 approaches such as urban greening, 
restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems reduce 
a range of climate change risks, including ﬂood risks, urban heat 
and provide multiple co-beneﬁts. Some land-based adaptation 
options provide immediate beneﬁts (e.g., conservation of peatlands,

wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests); while afforestation and 
reforestation, restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, agroforestry, and 
the reclamation of degraded soils take more time to deliver measurable 
results. Signiﬁcant synergies exist between adaptation and mitigation, 
for example through sustainable land management approaches. 
Agroecological principles and practices and other approaches 
that work with natural processes support food security, nutrition, 
health and well-being, livelihoods and biodiversity, sustainability and 
ecosystem services. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2,

Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems 
and structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case 
of inland ﬂooding (medium conﬁdence) and early warning systems 
along with ﬂood-prooﬁng of buildings have proven to be cost-effective 
in the context of coastal ﬂooding under current sea level rise (high 
conﬁdence). Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and 
response systems are effective adaptation options for extreme heat 
(high conﬁdence). Effective adaptation options for water, food and 
vector-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, 
reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to extreme weather 
events, and improved early warning systems, surveillance, and vaccine 
development (very high conﬁdence). Adaptation options such as 
disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services 
and social safety nets have broad applicability across multiple sectors 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.5, WGII SPM C.2.9, 
WGII SPM C.2.11, WGII SPM C.2.13; SROCC SPM C.3.2}
Integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that address social inequities, 
differentiate responses based on climate risk and cut across systems, 
increase the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation in multiple 
sectors (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2}

Current Status and Trends
Section 2
2.3 Current Mitigation and Adaptation Actions and Policies are not Sufﬁcient
At the time of the present assessment88 there are gaps between global ambitions and the sum of declared 
national ambitions. These are further compounded by gaps between declared national ambitions and current 
implementation for all aspects of climate action. For mitigation, global GHG emissions in 2030 implied by NDCs 
announced by October 2021 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would 
make it harder to limit warming below 2°C.89 Despite progress, adaptation gaps90 persist, with many initiatives 
prioritising short-term risk reduction, hindering transformational adaptation. Hard and soft limits to adaptation 
are being reached in some sectors and regions, while maladaptation is also increasing and disproportionately 
affecting vulnerable groups. Systemic barriers such as funding, knowledge, and practice gaps, including lack of 
climate literacy and data hinders adaptation progress. Insufﬁcient ﬁnancing, especially for adaptation, constraints 
climate action in particular in developing countries. (high conﬁdence)

2.3.1. The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and 
Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C
Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation 
of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that 
warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would 
make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional 
commitments are made or actions taken (Figure 2.5, Table 2.2). 
A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 
associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 
would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and 
higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or to 
2°C (>67%), assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, 
and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade (high 
conﬁdence) (Table 2.2, Table 3.1, 4.1).92 The magnitude of the emissions 
gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only 
unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs93 are considered 
(high conﬁdence) (Table 2.2). Modelled pathways that are consistent 
with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no 
increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading

NDCs announced prior to COP26 refer to the most recent NDCs submitted to the UNFCCC up to the literature cut-off date of the WGIII report, 11 October 2021, and revised 
NDCs announced by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea prior to October 2021 but only submitted thereafter. 25 NDC updates were submitted between 12 October 2021 
and the start of COP26. {WGIII SPM footnote 24}
92 
Immediate action in modelled global pathways refers to the adoption between 2020 and at latest before 2025 of climate policies intended to limit global warming to a given 
level. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) based on immediate action are summarised in category C3a in Table 3.1. All assessed modelled global pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot assume immediate action as deﬁned here (Category C1 in Table 3.1). {WGIII SPM footnote 26}
93 
In this report, ‘unconditional’ elements of NDCs refer to mitigation efforts put forward without any conditions. ‘Conditional’ elements refer to mitigation efforts that are 
contingent on international cooperation, for example bilateral and multilateral agreements, ﬁnancing or monetary and/or technological transfers. This terminology is used in the 
literature and the UNFCCC’s NDC Synthesis Reports, not by the Paris Agreement. {WGIII SPM footnote 27}
94 
Implementation gaps refer to how far currently enacted policies and actions fall short of reaching the pledges. The policy cut-off date in studies used to project GHG emissions 
of ‘policies implemented by the end of 2020’ varies between July 2019 and November 2020. {WGIII Table 4.2, WGIII SPM footnote 25} 
to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 (medium 
conﬁdence). If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions 
in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely 
that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting 
warming to 2°C (>67%) would imply an unprecedented acceleration of 
mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 (medium conﬁdence) (see Section 4.1, 
Cross-Section Box.2). {WGIII SPM B.6, WGIII SPM B.6.1, WGIII SPM B.6.3, 
WGIII SPM B.6.4, WGIII SPM C.1.1}
Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in 
higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, 
indicating an ‘implementation gap94’ (high conﬁdence) (Table 2.2, 
Figure 2.5). Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented 
by the end of 2020 are 57 (52–60) GtCO2-eq in 2030 (Table 2.2). This 
points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4 to 
7 GtCO2-eq in 2030 (Table 2.2); without a strengthening of policies, 
emissions are projected to rise, leading to a median global warming 
of 2.2°C to 3.5°C (very likely range) by 2100 (medium confidence)
(see Section 3.1.1). {WGIII SPM B.6.1, WGIII SPM C.1}

Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing 
fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement95 exceed the 
total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 
1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately 
equal to total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit 
warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83%96 (see Figure 3.5). Limiting 
warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower will result in stranded assets. 
About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be 
burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Signiﬁcantly more 
reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to 
1.5°C. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM B.7, WGIII Box 6.3}

Figure 2.5 Global GHG emissions of modelled pathways (funnels in Panel a), and projected emission outcomes from near-term policy assessments for 2030 (Panel b). 
Panel a shows global GHG emissions over 2015-2050 for four types of assessed modelled global pathways:
 
- Trend from implemented policies: Pathways with projected near-term GHG emissions in line with policies implemented until the end of 2020 and extended with comparable 
ambition  levels beyond 2030 (29 scenarios across categories C5–C7, WGIII Table SPM.2).
 
- Limit to 2°C (>67%) or return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot, NDCs until 2030: Pathways with GHG emissions until 2030 associated with the 
implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26, followed by accelerated emissions reductions likely to limit warming to 2°C (C3b, WGIII Table SPM.2) or to return 
warming to 1.5°C with a probability of 50% or greater after high overshoot (subset of 42 scenarios from C2, WGIII Table SPM.2). 
 
- Limit to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action: Pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action after 2020 (C3a, WGIII Table SPM.2). 
 
- Limit to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot: Pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (C1, WGIII Table SPM.2 C1). 
All these pathways assume immediate action after 2020. Past GHG emissions for 2010-2015 used to project global warming outcomes of the modelled pathways are shown by a 
black line. Panel b shows a snapshot of the GHG emission ranges of the modelled pathways in 2030 and projected emissions outcomes from near-term policy assessments in 2030 
from WGIII Chapter 4.2 (Tables 4.2 and 4.3; median and full range). GHG emissions are CO2-equivalent using GWP100 from AR6 WGI. {WGIII Figure SPM.4, WGIII 3.5, 4.2, Table 4.2, 
Table 4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4} (Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2)

Section 2
Section 1
Section 2
Cross-Section Box.1: Understanding Net Zero CO2 and Net Zero GHG Emissions 
Limiting human-caused global warming to a speciﬁc level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative 
CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other GHG emissions (see 3.3.2). Future additional warming will depend on future emissions, 
with total warming dominated by past and future cumulative CO2 emissions. {WGI SPM D.1.1, WGI Figure SPM.4; SR1.5 SPM A.2.2} 
Reaching net zero CO2 emissions is different from reaching net zero GHG emissions. The timing of net zero for a basket of GHGs depends 
on the emissions metric, such as global warming potential over a 100-year period, chosen to convert non-CO2 emissions into CO2-equivalent (high 
conﬁdence). However, for a given emissions pathway, the physical climate response is independent of the metric chosen (high conﬁdence). 
{WGI SPM D.1.8; WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 2}
Achieving global net zero GHG emissions requires all remaining CO2 and metric-weighted98 non-CO2 GHG emissions to be 
counterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals (high conﬁdence). Some non-CO2 emissions, such as CH4 and N2O from agriculture, 
cannot be fully eliminated using existing and anticipated technical measures. {WGIII SPM C.2.4, WGIII SPM C.11.4, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3}
Global net zero CO2 or GHG emissions can be achieved even if some sectors and regions are net emitters, provided that 
others reach net negative emissions (see Figure 4.1). The potential and cost of achieving net zero or even net negative emissions 
vary by sector and region. If and when net zero emissions for a given sector or region are reached depends on multiple factors, including 
the potential to reduce GHG emissions and undertake carbon dioxide removal, the associated costs, and the availability of policy 
mechanisms to balance emissions and removals between sectors and countries. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3}
The adoption and implementation of net zero emission targets by countries and regions also depend on equity and capacity 
considerations (high conﬁdence). The formulation of net zero pathways by countries will beneﬁt from clarity on scope, plans-of-action, and 
fairness. Achieving net zero emission targets relies on policies, institutions, and milestones against which to track progress. Least-cost global 
modelled pathways have been shown to distribute the mitigation effort unevenly, and the incorporation of equity principles could change the 
country-level timing of net zero (high conﬁdence). The Paris Agreement also recognizes that peaking of emissions will occur later in developing 
countries than developed countries (Article 4.1). {WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3, WGIII 14.3}
More information on country-level net zero pledges is provided in Section 2.3.1, on the timing of global net zero emissions in Section 3.3.2, and 
on sectoral aspects of net zero in Section 4.1.

Current Status and Trends
Section 2
Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net 
zero GHG or net zero CO2 emissions by around mid-century 
(Cross-Section Box.1). More than 100 countries have either adopted, 
announced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO2 emissions 
commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. 
A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero 
GHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced 
net zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission 
pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and speciﬁcity, and 
limited policies are to date in place to deliver on them. {WGIII SPM C.6.4, 
WGIII TS.4.1, WGIII Table TS.1, WGIII 13.9, WGIII 14.3, WGIII 14.5} 
All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, 
including technology risks, scaling, and costs (high conﬁdence). 
Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that 
need to be addressed to enable their application at scale (medium 
conﬁdence). Current development pathways may create behavioural, 
spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all 
scales (high conﬁdence). Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the 
private sector and other stakeholders inﬂuence societies’ development 
pathways (high conﬁdence). Structural factors of national circumstances 
and capabilities (e.g., economic and natural endowments, political 
systems and cultural factors and gender considerations) affect the 
breadth and depth of climate governance (medium conﬁdence). The 
extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, 
labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged 
inﬂuences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual 
policy outcomes (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.3.6, WGIII SPM E.1.1, 
WGIII SPM E.2.1, WGIII SPM E.3.3}
The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most 
developing countries, particularly least developed ones, 
due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited 
ﬁnance, technology development and transfer, and capacity 
(medium conﬁdence). In many countries, especially those with 
limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have 
been observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, 
e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge 
and suppliers (medium conﬁdence). Low-emission innovation along 
with strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development 
beneﬁts, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public 
support for policy (medium conﬁdence). Persistent and region-speciﬁc 
barriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility 
of deploying AFOLU mitigation options (medium conﬁdence). Barriers to 
implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufﬁcient institutional and 
ﬁnancial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, 
weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack 
of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal (high 
conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.4.2, WGIII SPM C.9.1, WGIII SPM C.9.3}

See Annex I: Glossary. 
100  Adaptation limit: The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. Hard adaptation limit 
- No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. Soft adaptation limit - Options are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.
101 Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability 
to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. See Annex I: Glossary.
2.3.2. Adaptation Gaps and Barriers 
Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current 
levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts 
and reduce climate risks (high conﬁdence). While progress in 
adaptation implementation is observed across all sectors and regions 
(very high conﬁdence), many adaptation initiatives prioritise immediate 
and near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard ﬂood protection, 
which reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation99 (high 
conﬁdence). Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, 
incremental, sector-speciﬁc, and focused more on planning rather than 
implementation (high conﬁdence). Further, observed adaptation is 
unequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation gaps 
exist among lower population income groups (high conﬁdence). In the 
urban context, the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage 
complex risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or 
the inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk (high conﬁdence). 
Many funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation and current adaptation 
efforts are not expected to meet existing goals (high conﬁdence). 
At current rates of adaptation planning and implementation the 
adaptation gap will continue to grow (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.1, 
WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.4.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.1.4} 
Soft and hard adaptation limits100 have already been reached in 
some sectors and regions, in spite of adaptation having buffered 
some climate impacts (high conﬁdence). Ecosystems already 
reaching hard adaptation limits include some warm water coral reefs, 
some coastal wetlands, some rainforests, and some polar and mountain 
ecosystems (high conﬁdence). Individuals and households in low lying 
coastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers 
in Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia have reached 
soft limits (medium conﬁdence), resulting from ﬁnancial, governance, 
institutional and policy constraints and can be overcome by addressing 
these constraints (high conﬁdence). Transitioning from incremental to 
transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM C.3.2, 
WGII SPM C.3.3, WGII SPM.C.3.4, WGII 16 ES}
Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with 
effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses 
and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and 
sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current ﬁnancial, 
governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable 
developing countries. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM.C.3.5}
There is increased evidence of maladaptation101 in various sectors 
and regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas 
(e.g., new urban infrastructure that cannot be adjusted easily or affordably), 
agriculture (e.g., using high-cost irrigation in areas projected to have more 
intense drought conditions), ecosystems (e.g. ﬁre suppression in naturally 
62
Section 2
Section 1
Section 2
ﬁre-adapted ecosystems, or hard defences against ﬂooding) and human 
settlements (e.g. stranded assets and vulnerable communities that 
cannot afford to shift away or adapt and require an increase in social 
safety nets). Maladaptation especially affects marginalised and vulnerable 
groups adversely (e.g., Indigenous Peoples, ethnic minorities, low-income 
households, people living in informal settlements), reinforcing and 
entrenching existing inequities. Maladaptation can be avoided by ﬂexible, 
multi-sectoral, inclusive and long-term planning and implementation of 
adaptation actions with beneﬁts to many sectors and systems. (high 
conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.4, WGII SPM C.4.3, WGII TS.D.3.1}
Systemic barriers constrain the implementation of adaptation 
options in vulnerable sectors, regions and social groups (high 
conﬁdence). Key barriers include limited resources, lack of private-sector 
and civic engagement, insufﬁcient mobilisation of ﬁnance, lack of political 
commitment, limited research and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation 
science and a low sense of urgency. Inequity and poverty also constrain 
adaptation, leading to soft limits and resulting in disproportionate 
exposure and impacts for most vulnerable groups (high conﬁdence). The 
largest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups 
(high conﬁdence). 
As adaptation options often have long implementation 
times, long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly 
in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that 
constraints remain for some regions (high conﬁdence). Prioritisation of 
options and transitions from incremental to transformational adaptation 
are limited due to vested interests, economic lock-ins, institutional 
path dependencies and prevalent practices, cultures, norms and belief 
systems (high conﬁdence). Many funding, knowledge and practice 
gaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation 
of adaptation (high conﬁdence), including, lack of climate literacy at 
all levels and limited availability of data and information (medium 
conﬁdence); for example for Africa, severe climate data constraints and 
inequities in research funding and leadership reduce adaptive capacity 
(very high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, 
WGII TS.D.1.5, WGII TS.D.2.4}
2.3.3. Lack of Finance as a Barrier to Climate Action 
Insufﬁcient ﬁnancing, and a lack of political frameworks and 
incentives for ﬁnance, are key causes of the implementation 
gaps for both mitigation and adaptation (high conﬁdence). 
Financial ﬂows remained heavily focused on mitigation, are 
uneven, and have developed heterogeneously across regions 
and sectors (high conﬁdence). In 2018, public and publicly mobilised 
private climate ﬁnance ﬂows from developed to developing countries 
were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement 
to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of 
meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation 
(medium conﬁdence). Public and private ﬁnance ﬂows for fossil fuels 
are still greater than those for climate adaptation and mitigation (high 
conﬁdence). The overwhelming majority of tracked climate ﬁnance 
is directed towards mitigation (very high conﬁdence). Nevertheless, 
average annual modelled investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 
in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three 
to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments 
(public, private, domestic and international) would need to increase 
across all sectors and regions (medium conﬁdence). Challenges 
remain for green bonds and similar products, in particular around 
integrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of 
these markets to many developing countries (high confidence). 
{WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.5.1} 
Current global ﬁnancial ﬂows for adaptation including from public 
and private ﬁnance sources, are insufﬁcient for and constrain 
implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing 
countries (high conﬁdence). There are widening disparities between 
the estimated costs of adaptation and the documented ﬁnance 
allocated to adaptation (high conﬁdence). Adaptation ﬁnance 
needs are estimated to be higher than those assessed in AR5, and 
the enhanced mobilisation of and access to ﬁnancial resources are 
essential for implementation of adaptation and to reduce adaptation 
gaps (high conﬁdence). Annual ﬁnance ﬂows targeting adaptation for 
Africa, for example, are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation 
cost estimates for near-term climate change (high conﬁdence). Adverse 
climate impacts can further reduce the availability of ﬁnancial resources 
by causing losses and damages and impeding national economic 
growth, thereby further increasing ﬁnancial constraints for adaptation 
particularly for developing countries and LDCs (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII TS.D.1.6} 
Without effective mitigation and adaptation, losses and damages will 
continue to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable 
populations. Accelerated ﬁnancial support for developing countries 
from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler to 
enhance mitigation action {WGIII SPM. E.5.3}. Many developing 
countries lack comprehensive data at the scale needed and lack adequate 
ﬁnancial resources needed for adaptation for reducing associated 
economic and non-economic losses and damages. (high conﬁdence) 
{WGII Cross-Chapter Box LOSS, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM C.3.2, 
WGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.1.5; WGIII SPM E.5.3} 
There are barriers to redirecting capital towards climate action both 
within and outside the global ﬁnancial sector. These barriers include: 
the inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment 
opportunities, regional mismatch between available capital and 
investment needs, home bias factors, country indebtedness levels, 
economic vulnerability, and limited institutional capacities. Challenges 
from outside the ﬁnancial sector include: limited local capital markets; 
unattractive risk-return proﬁles, in particular due to missing or weak 
regulatory environments that are inconsistent with ambition levels; 
limited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards; standardisation, 
aggregation, scalability and replicability of investment opportunities 
and ﬁnancing models; and, a pipeline ready for commercial investments.

Current Status and Trends
Section 2
Cross-Section Box.2: Scenarios, Global Warming Levels, and Risks
Modelled scenarios and pathways102 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and possible mitigation and 
adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables and mitigation options. These are quantitative 
projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission pathways, including those based on cost effective approaches 
contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, and have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most 
do not make explicit assumptions about global equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard 
to the assumptions underlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures103. {WGI Box SPM.1; 
WGII Box SPM.1; WGIII Box SPM.1; SROCC Box SPM.1; SRCCL Box SPM.1} 
Socio-economic Development, Scenarios, and Pathways
The ﬁve Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1 to SSP5) were designed to span a range of challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
For the assessment of climate impacts, risk and adaptation, the SSPs are used for future exposure, vulnerability and challenges to adaptation. 
Depending on levels of GHG mitigation, modelled emissions scenarios based on the SSPs can be consistent with low or high warming levels104. 
There are many different mitigation strategies that could be consistent with different levels of global warming in 2100 (see Figure 4.1). 
{WGI Box SPM.1; WGII Box SPM.1; WGIII Box SPM.1, WGIII Box TS.5, WGIII Annex III; SRCCL Box SPM.1, SRCCL Figure SPM.2}
WGI assessed the climate response to ﬁve illustrative scenarios based on SSPs105 that cover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic 
drivers of climate change found in the literature. These scenarios combine socio-economic assumptions, levels of climate mitigation, land use and 
air pollution controls for aerosols and non-CH4 ozone precursors. The high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) have 
CO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively106. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) 
has CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and 
SSP1-2.6) have CO2 emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 
emissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)107 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate changes, 
impacts and risks. {WGI Box SPM.1} (Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)
In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways were categorised based on their 
projected global warming over the 21st century, with categories ranging from pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% 
likelihood108 with no or limited overshoot (C1) to pathways that exceed 4°C (C8). Methods to project global warming associated with the 
modelled pathways were updated to ensure consistency with the AR6 WGI assessment of the climate system response109. {WGIII Box SPM.1,WGIII 
Table 3.1} (Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)
102 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI primarily used the term 
scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emissions and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when referring to WGI and modelled emissions and 
mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII. {WGI Box SPM.1; WGIII footnote 44}
103 Around half of all modelled global emissions pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The other half look 
at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.  The underlying population assumptions range from 8.5 to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 7.4 to 10.9 billion 
in 2100 (5–95th percentile) starting from 7.6 billion in 2019. The underlying assumptions on global GDP growth range from 2.5 to 3.5% per year in the 2019–2050 period 
and 1.3 to 2.1% per year in the 2050–2100 (5–95th percentile). {WGIII Box SPM.1}
104 High mitigation challenges, for example, due to assumptions of slow technological change, high levels of global population growth, and high fragmentation as in the Shared 
Socio-economic Pathway SSP3, may render modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (> 67%) or lower infeasible (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.1.4; SRCCL Box SPM.1}
105 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios, and 
‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or Wm–2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {WGI SPM footnote 22}
106 Very high emission scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Temperature levels > 4°C may result from very high emission scenarios, but can also occur from 
lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {WGIII SPM C.1.3}
107 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or Wm–2) resulting from the scenario in the 
year 2100. {WGII SPM footnote 21}
108 Denoted ‘>50%’ in this report.
109 The climate response to emissions is investigated with climate models, paleoclimatic insights and other lines of evidence. The assessment outcomes are used to categorise 
thousands of scenarios via simple physically-based climate models (emulators). {WGI TS.1.2.2}

Global Warming Levels (GWLs)
For many climate and risk variables, the geographical patterns of changes in climatic impact-drivers110 and climate impacts for a level of global 
warming111 are common to all scenarios considered and independent of timing when that level is reached. This motivates the use of GWLs as a 
dimension of integration. {WGI Box SPM.1.4, WGI TS.1.3.2; WGII Box SPM.1} (Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2)
Risks
Dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards, exposure and vulnerability of the affected human society, species, or ecosystems result 
in risks arising from climate change. AR6 assesses key risks across sectors and regions as well as providing an updated assessment of the 
Reasons for Concern (RFCs) – ﬁve globally aggregated categories of risk that evaluate risk accrual with increasing global surface temperature. 
Risks can also arise from climate change mitigation or adaptation responses when the response does not achieve its intended objective, or when 
it results in adverse effects for other societal objectives. {WGII SPM A, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII Box TS.1, WGII Figure TS.4; SR1.5 Figure SPM.2; 
SROCC Errata Figure SPM.3; SRCCL Figure SPM.2} (3.1.2, Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1, Figure 3.3)
110 See Annex I: Glossary
111 See Annex I: Glossary. Here, global warming is the 20-year average global surface temperature relative to 1850–1900. The assessed time of when a certain global warming level 
is reached under a particular scenario is deﬁned here as the mid-point of the ﬁrst 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature 
change exceeds the level of global warming. {WGI SPM footnote 26, Cross-Section Box TS.1}

* The terminology SSPx-y is used, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway or ‘SSP’ describing the socio-economic trends 
underlying the scenario, and ‘y’ refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or Wm–2) resulting from the 
scenario in the year 2100.
** The AR5 scenarios (RCPy), which partly inform the AR6 WGI and WGII assessments, are indexed to a similar set of approximate 2100 radiative 
forcing levels (in W m-2). The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of GHG and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not 
identical, with differences in concentration trajectories for different GHGs. The overall radiative forcing tends to be higher for the SSPs compared 
to the RCPs with the same label (medium conﬁdence). {WGI TS.1.3.1}
*** Limited overshoot refers to exceeding 1.5°C global warming by up to about 0.1°C, high overshoot by 0.1°C-0.3°C, in both cases for up to 
several decades.

Section 3: Long-Term Climate and Development Futures
3.1 Long-Term Climate Change, Impacts and Related Risks
Future warming will be driven by future emissions and will affect all major climate system components, with 
every region experiencing multiple and co-occurring changes. Many climate-related risks are assessed to be 
higher than in previous assessments, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher than 
currently observed. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in compounding and cascading 
risks across sectors and regions. Sea level rise, as well as other irreversible changes, will continue for thousands 
of years, at rates depending on future emissions. (high conﬁdence)
3.1.1. Long-term Climate Change
The uncertainty range on assessed future changes in global 
surface temperature is narrower than in the AR5. For the ﬁrst 
time in an IPCC assessment cycle, multi-model projections of global 
surface temperature, ocean warming and sea level are constrained 
using observations and the assessed climate sensitivity. The likely 
range of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been narrowed to 2.5°C 
to 4.0°C (with a best estimate of 3.0°C) based on multiple lines of 
evidence112, including improved understanding of cloud feedbacks. For 
related emissions scenarios, this leads to narrower uncertainty ranges 
for long-term projected global temperature change than in AR5. 
{WGI A.4, WGI Box SPM.1, WGI TS.3.2, WGI 4.3}
Future warming depends on future GHG emissions, with 
cumulative net CO2 dominating. The assessed best estimates and 
very likely ranges of warming for 2081-2100 with respect to 1850–1900 
vary from 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8]°C in the very low GHG emissions scenario 
(SSP1-1.9) to 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C in the intermediate GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP2-4.5) and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7]°C in the very high GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP5-8.5)113. {WGI SPM B.1.1, WGI Table SPM.1, WGI Figure 
SPM.4} (Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)
Modelled pathways consistent with the continuation of policies 
implemented by the end of 2020 lead to global warming of 
3.2 [2.2 to 3.5]°C (5–95% range) by 2100 (medium conﬁdence) 
(see also Section 2.3.1). Pathways of >4°C (≥50%) by 2100 would 
imply a reversal of current technology and/or mitigation policy trends 
(medium conﬁdence). However, such warming could occur in emissions 
pathways consistent with policies implemented by the end of 2020 if 
climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best 
estimate (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.1.3}
112  Understanding of climate processes, the instrumental record, paleoclimates and model-based emergent constraints (see Annex I: Glossary). {WGI SPM footnote 21}
113 The best estimates [and very likely ranges] for the different scenarios are: 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8]°C (SSP1-1.9); 1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]°C (SSP1-2.6); 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C (SSP2-4.5); 3.6 [2.8 to 4.6]°C 
(SSP3-7.0); and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7]°C (SSP5-8.5). {WGI Table SPM.1} (Cross-Section Box.2)
114 In the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under 
the intermediate and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely 
than not to be reached under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). In all scenarios considered by WGI except the very high emissions scenario, the midpoint of the 
ﬁrst 20-year running average period during which the assessed global warming reaches 1.5°C lies in the ﬁrst half of the 2030s. In the very high GHG emissions scenario, this 
mid-point is in the late 2020s. The median ﬁve-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered 
in WGIII is 2030–2035. {WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI Cross-Section Box TS.1, WGIII Table 3.2} (Cross-Section Box.2)
115 See Cross-Section Box.2.
116 Based on additional scenarios.
Global warming will continue to increase in the near term in 
nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Deep, 
rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions, reaching net 
zero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions 
of other GHGs, in particular CH4, are necessary to limit warming 
to 1.5°C (>50%) or less than 2°C (>67%) by the end of century 
(high conﬁdence). The best estimate of reaching 1.5°C of global 
warming lies in the ﬁrst half of the 2030s in most of the considered 
scenarios and modelled pathways114. In the very low GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP1-1.9), CO2 emissions reach net zero around 2050 and the 
best-estimate end-of-century warming is 1.4°C, after a temporary overshoot 
(see Section 3.3.4) of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming. 
Global warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless 
deep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming 
decades. Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would 
lead to improvements in air quality within a few years, to reductions in 
trends of global surface temperature discernible after around 20 years, 
and over longer time periods for many other climate impact-drivers115 
(high conﬁdence). Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead 
to more rapid improvements in air quality compared to reductions 
in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are 
projected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as 
well as GHG emissions (high conﬁdence)116. {WGI SPM B.1, WGI SPM B.1.3, 
WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.2, WGI Figure SPM.4, WGI Table SPM.1, 
WGI Cross-Section Box TS.1; WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII Table SPM.2, 
WGIII Figure SPM.5, WGIII Box SPM.1 Figure 1, WGIII Table 3.2} (Table 3.1, 
Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)
Changes in short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) resulting from the 
ﬁve considered scenarios lead to an additional net global warming 
in the near and long term (high conﬁdence). Simultaneous 
stringent climate change mitigation and air pollution control 
69
Long-Term Climate and Development Futures
Section 3
policies limit this additional warming and lead to strong beneﬁts 
for air quality (high conﬁdence). In high and very high GHG 
emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes 
in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a 
net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. 
This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, 
tropospheric ozone, hydroﬂuorocarbons and, when strong air pollution 
control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very 
low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution 
control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a 
net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead 
to a net warming (high conﬁdence). Altogether, this causes a likely net 
warming of 0.0°C to 0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 
and strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter 
(high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI Box TS.7} (Cross-Section Box.2)
Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate 
system components, and many changes will be irreversible on 
centennial to millennial time scales. Many changes in the climate 
system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. 
With every additional increment of global warming, changes in 
extremes continue to become larger. Additional warming will lead to 
more frequent and intense marine heatwaves and is projected to further 
amplify permafrost thawing and loss of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, 
land ice and Arctic sea ice (high conﬁdence). Continued global warming 
is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its 
variability, global monsoon precipitation117, and very wet and very dry 
weather and climate events and seasons (high conﬁdence). The portion 
of global land experiencing detectable changes in seasonal mean 
precipitation is projected to increase (medium conﬁdence) with more 
variable precipitation and surface water ﬂows over most land regions 
within seasons (high conﬁdence) and from year to year (medium 
conﬁdence). Many changes due to past and future GHG emissions are 
irreversible118 on centennial to millennial time scales, especially in the 
ocean, ice sheets and global sea level (see 3.1.3). Ocean acidiﬁcation 
(virtually certain), ocean deoxygenation (high conﬁdence) and global 
mean sea level (virtually certain) will continue to increase in the 21st century, 
at rates dependent on future emissions. {WGI SPM B.2, WGI SPM B.2.2,

WGI Figure SPM.8} (Figure 3.1)
With further global warming, every region is projected to 
increasingly experience concurrent and multiple changes 
in climatic impact-drivers. Increases in hot and decreases in 
cold climatic impact-drivers, such as temperature extremes, are 
projected in all regions (high conﬁdence). At 1.5°C global warming, 
heavy precipitation and ﬂooding events are projected to intensify 
and become more frequent in most regions in Africa, Asia (high 
conﬁdence), North America (medium to high conﬁdence) and Europe 
(medium conﬁdence). At 2°C or above, these changes expand to more 
regions and/or become more signiﬁcant (high conﬁdence), and more 
frequent and/or severe agricultural and ecological droughts are projected 
in Europe, Africa, Australasia and North, Central and South America 
(medium to high conﬁdence). Other projected regional changes include

3.1.2 Impacts and Related Risks
For a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are 
assessed to be higher than in AR5 (high conﬁdence). Levels of 
risk120 for all Reasons for Concern121 (RFCs) are assessed to become high 
to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was 
assessed in AR5 (high conﬁdence). This is based upon recent evidence 
of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new 
knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural 
systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level 
of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to 
multiple times higher than currently observed (high confidence) for 
127 identiﬁed key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people 
and species. Risks, including cascading risks (see 3.1.3) and risks from 
overshoot (see 3.3.4), are projected to become increasingly severe 
with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). 
{WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII SPM B.4, WGII SPM B.5, WGII 16.6.3; SRCCL SPM A5.3} 
(Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3)
Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for 
global warming of 1.5°C than at present (1.1°C) but lower than at 2°C 
(high conﬁdence) (see Section 2.1.2). Climate-related risks to health, 
livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic 
growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. In 
terrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species 
assessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. 
Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of 
global warming (high conﬁdence). At this GWL, many low-elevation 
and small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or 
disappear within decades to centuries (high conﬁdence). Regions at 
disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, 
small island developing states and Least Developed Countries (high 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII TS.C.4.2; SR1.5 SPM A.3, 
SR1.5 SPM B.4.2, SR1.5 SPM B.5, SR1.5 SPM B.5.1} (Figure 3.3)
At 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal 
distribution of impacts (RFC3), global aggregate impacts (RFC4) and 
large-scale singular events (RFC5) would be transitioning to high (medium 
conﬁdence), those associated with extreme weather events (RFC2) would 
be transitioning to very high (medium conﬁdence), and those associated 
with unique and threatened systems (RFC1) would be very high (high 
conﬁdence) (Figure 3.3, panel a). With about 2°C warming, climate-related 
120 Undetectable risk level indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk indicates associated impacts are both detectable and 
attributable to climate change with at least medium conﬁdence, also accounting for the other speciﬁc criteria for key risks; high risk indicates severe and widespread impacts that 
are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level indicates very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of signiﬁcant irreversibility 
or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impacts/risks. {WGII Figure SPM.3}
121 The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientiﬁc understanding about accrual of risk for ﬁve broad categories (WGII Figure SPM.3). RFC1: Unique and 
threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive 
properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to 
human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildﬁres, and coastal ﬂooding. RFC3: 
Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. 
RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives affected, species lost 
or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, 
such as ice sheet instability or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods include a structured expert elicitation based on the literature described in WGII SM16.6 
and are identical to AR5 but are enhanced by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6. For further explanations of global 
risk levels and Reasons for Concern, see WGII TS.AII. {WGII Figure SPM.3}
changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase 
nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, 
affecting tens (under low vulnerability and low warming) to hundreds of 
millions of people (under high vulnerability and high warming), particularly 
among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America (high conﬁdence). 
For example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected 
to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20% 
(medium conﬁdence). Climate change risks to cities, settlements 
and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid and long term with 
further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high 
temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities (high 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII SPM B.4.2, WGII SPM B.4.5, WGII TS C.3.3, 
WGII TS.C.12.2} (Figure 3.3)
At global warming of 3°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions 
reach high or very high levels, implying widespread systemic impacts, 
irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits (see Section 3.2) 
(high conﬁdence). For example, very high extinction risk for endemic 
species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to increase at least tenfold 
if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C (medium conﬁdence). Projected 
increases in direct ﬂood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C 
and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global warming without 
adaptation (medium conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII SPM B.4.2, 
WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII TS Appendix AII, WGII Appendix I Global to 
Regional Atlas Figure AI.46} (Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3)
Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching 
impacts on natural and human systems (high conﬁdence). Beyond 
4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local 
extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species (medium conﬁdence) 
and biome shifts across 35% of global land area (medium conﬁdence). 
At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area 
is projected to face both increasing high and decreasing low extreme 
streamﬂow, affecting, without additional adaptation, over 2.1 billion people 
(medium conﬁdence) and about 4 billion people are projected to 
experience water scarcity (medium conﬁdence). At 4°C of warming, the 
global burned area is projected to increase by 50 to 70% and the 
fire frequency by ~30% compared to today (medium confidence).

Projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from 
climate change escalate with every increment of global warming 
(very high conﬁdence), but they will also strongly depend on 
socio-economic development trajectories and adaptation actions 
to reduce vulnerability and exposure (high conﬁdence). For 
example, development pathways with higher demand for food, animal 
feed, and water, more resource-intensive consumption and production, 
and limited technological improvements result in higher risks from 
water scarcity in drylands, land degradation and food insecurity (high 
conﬁdence). Changes in, for example, demography or investments in 
health systems have effect on a variety of health-related outcomes 
including heat-related morbidity and mortality (Figure 3.3 Panel d). 
{WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4, WGII Figure SPM.3; SRCCL SPM A.6}
With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and 
risks will become increasingly complex and more difﬁcult to 
manage. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in 
the probability of compound events with higher global warming, such 
as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound ﬂooding and ﬁre 
weather. In addition, multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers 
such as biodiversity loss or violent conﬂict will interact, resulting 
in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and 
regions. Furthermore, risks can arise from some responses that are 
intended to reduce the risks of climate change, e.g., adverse side effects 
of some emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures 
(see 3.4.1). (high confidence) {WGI SPM C.2.7, WGI Figure SPM.6, 
WGI TS.4.3; WGII SPM B.1.7, WGII B.2.2, WGII SPM B.5, WGII SPM B.5.4, 
WGII SPM C.4.2, WGII SPM B.5, WGII CCB2}
Solar Radiation Modiﬁcation (SRM) approaches, if they were 
to be implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks 
to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. 
SRM has the potential to offset warming within one or two decades 
and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not restore climate to 
a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate 
change would occur at regional and seasonal scales (high conﬁdence). 
Effects of SRM would depend on the speciﬁc approach used122, and 
a sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions 
scenario would cause rapid climate change (high conﬁdence). SRM 
would not stop atmospheric CO2 concentrations from increasing nor 
reduce resulting ocean acidiﬁcation under continued anthropogenic 
emissions (high conﬁdence). Large uncertainties and knowledge 
gaps are associated with the potential of SRM approaches to reduce 
climate change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance 
poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create 
international tensions. {WGI 4.6; WGII SPM B.5.5; WGIII 14.4.5.1; 
WGIII 14 Cross-Working Group Box Solar Radiation Modification; 
SR1.5 SPM C.1.4}
122 Several SRM approaches have been proposed, including stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, ground-based albedo modiﬁcations, and ocean albedo change.

Figure 3.2: Projected risks and impacts of climate change on natural and human systems at different global warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850-1900 levels. 
Projected risks and impacts shown on the maps are based on outputs from different subsets of Earth system models that were used to project each impact indicator without 
additional adaptation. WGII provides further assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems using these projections and additional lines of evidence. (a) Risks of species 
losses as indicated by the percentage of assessed species exposed to potentially dangerous temperature conditions, as deﬁned by conditions beyond the estimated historical 
(1850–2005) maximum mean annual temperature experienced by each species, at GWLs of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C. Underpinning projections of temperature are from 21 Earth 
system models and do not consider extreme events impacting ecosystems such as the Arctic. (b) Risk to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure 
to hypothermic conditions that pose a risk of mortality from surface air temperature and humidity conditions for historical period (1991–2005) and at GWLs of 1.7°C to 2.3°C 
(mean = 1.9°C; 13 climate models), 2.4°C to 3.1°C (2.7°C; 16 climate models) and 4.2°C to 5.4°C (4.7°C; 15 climate models). Interquartile ranges of WGLs by 2081–2100 
under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The presented index is consistent with common features found in many indices included within WGI and WGII assessments. (c) Impacts 
on food production: (c1) Changes in maize yield at projected GWLs of 1.6°C to 2.4°C (2.0°C), 3.3°C to 4.8°C (4.1°C) and 3.9°C to 6.0°C (4.9°C). Median yield changes 
from an ensemble of 12 crop models, each driven by bias-adjusted outputs from 5 Earth system models from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project 
(AgMIP) and the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). Maps depict 2080–2099 compared to 1986–2005 for current growing regions (>10 ha), with the 
corresponding range of future global warming levels shown under SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. Hatching indicates areas where <70% of the climate-crop model 
combinations agree on the sign of impact. (c2) Changes in maximum ﬁsheries catch potential by 2081–2099 relative to 1986-2005 at projected GWLs of 0.9°C to 2.0°C (1.5°C) 
and 3.4°C to 5.2°C (4.3°C). GWLs by 2081–2100 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Hatching indicates where the two climate-ﬁsheries models disagree in the direction of change. Large 
relative changes in low yielding regions may correspond to small absolute changes. Biodiversity and ﬁsheries in Antarctica were not analysed due to data limitations. Food security 
is also affected by crop and ﬁshery failures not presented here. {WGII Fig. TS.5, WGII Fig TS.9, WGII Annex I: Global to Regional Atlas Figure AI.15, Figure AI.22, Figure AI.23, Figure

e) Examples of key risks in different regions
Absence of risk diagrams does not imply absence of risks within a region. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small 
Islands, Asia and Central and South America was limited due to the paucity of adequately downscaled climate projections, with 
uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and 
the resulting few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.
The risks listed are of at least medium conﬁdence level:

Long-Term Climate and Development Futures
Section 3
Figure 3.3: Synthetic risk diagrams of global and sectoral assessments and examples of regional key risks. The burning embers result from a literature based 
expert elicitation. Panel (a): Left - Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with 
observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity. Very likely ranges are shown for the low and high 
GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0). Right - Global Reasons for Concern, comparing AR6 (thick embers) and AR5 (thin embers) assessments. Diagrams are shown for 
each RFC, assuming low to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localised and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very 
high-risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.1°C which is used to separate the observed, past 
impacts below the line from the future projected risks above it. Lines connect the midpoints of the transition from moderate to high risk across AR5 and AR6. Panel (b): Risks for 
land-based systems and ocean/coastal ecosystems. Diagrams shown for each risk assume low to no adaptation. Text bubbles indicate examples of impacts at a given warming level. 
Panel (c): Left - Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. 
The future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and 
likely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Right - Assessment of the combined risk of coastal ﬂooding, erosion and salinization for four illustrative coastal geographies in 
2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels, under two response scenarios, with respect to the SROCC baseline period (1986–2005) and indicating the IPCC AR6 baseline 
period (1995–2014). The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in 
extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate response” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further signiﬁcant action or new types of actions). 
“Maximum potential response” represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus signiﬁcant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal 
ﬁnancial, social and political barriers. The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), 
coastal hazards (ﬂooding, shoreline erosion, salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defences, ecosystem restoration or creation of new natural buffers areas, and 
subsidence management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. The term 
response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Panel (d): Left - Heat-sensitive human 
health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under 
three SSP scenarios. Right - Risks associated with food security due to climate change and patterns of socio-economic development. Risks to food security include availability and 
access to food, including population at risk of hunger, food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed 
for two contrasted socio-economic pathways (SSP1 and SSP3) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation and adaptation policies. Panel (e): Examples of regional key risks. Risks 
identiﬁed are of at least medium conﬁdence level. Key risks are identiﬁed based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness of the consequences, degree of change, 
irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); likelihood of adverse consequences; 
temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. {WGI Figure SPM.8; WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII SM 16.6, WGII SM 16.7.4; 
SROCC Figure SPM.3d, SROCC SPM.5a, SROCC 4SM; SRCCL Figure SPM.2, SRCCL 7.3.1, SRCCL 7 SM} (Cross-Section Box.2)
3.1.3 The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible 
Change
The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts 
increase with higher global warming levels (high conﬁdence). 
As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or 
irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests (medium 
conﬁdence), coral reefs (very high conﬁdence) and in Arctic regions 
(high conﬁdence). Risks associated with large-scale singular events 
or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from 
tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C (medium 
conﬁdence) and to very high risk between 2.5°C to  4°C (low conﬁdence). 
The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations 
can be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century 
time scales (high conﬁdence). The probability of crossing uncertain 
regional thresholds increases with further warming (high conﬁdence).

Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due 
to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and 
sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years (high 
conﬁdence). Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st 
century (virtually certain), with projected regional relative sea level rise 
within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline 
(medium conﬁdence). The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold 
exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend 
on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates 
of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events 
that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur 
at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 
123 This outcome is characterised by deep uncertainty: Its likelihood defies quantitative assessment but is considered due to its high potential impact. {WGI Box TS.1; 
WGII Cross-Chapter Box DEEP}
and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue 
to increase beyond 2100 (high conﬁdence). At sustained warming 
levels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice 
sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple 
millennia (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss 
increase with higher global surface temperatures (high conﬁdence). 
Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 
2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C 
(low conﬁdence). Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level 
rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate 
periods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today 
roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to 
4°C higher than 1850–1900 (medium conﬁdence). Further examples 
of unavoidable changes in the climate system due to multi-decadal 
or longer response timescales include continued glacier melt (very high 
conﬁdence) and permafrost carbon loss (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B.5.2, 
WGI SPM B.5.3, WGI SPM B.5.4, WGI SPM C.2.5, WGI Box TS.4, 
WGI Box TS.9, WGI 9.5.1; WGII TS C.5; SROCC SPM B.3, SROCC SPM B.6, 
SROCC SPM B.9} (Figure 3.4)
The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with 
potentially very large impacts increases with higher global 
warming levels (high conﬁdence). Warming substantially above the 
assessed very likely range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and 
there is high conﬁdence this would lead to regional changes greater 
than assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, 
high-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming 
within the very likely assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. 
Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 
2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be ruled out due to 
deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes123 and would have severe

impacts on populations in low elevation coastal zones. If global 
warming increases, some compound extreme events124 will 
become more frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented 
intensities, durations or spatial extent (high confidence). The 
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken 
over the 21st century for all considered scenarios (high conﬁdence), 
however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 (medium 
conﬁdence). If such a low probability event were to occur, it would very 
likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, 
124 See Annex I: Glossary. Examples of compound extreme events are concurrent heatwaves and droughts or compound ﬂooding. {WGI SPM Footnote 18}
such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts 
on ecosystems and human activities. A sequence of large explosive 
volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a 
low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling 
globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades.

3.2 Long-term Adaptation Options and Limits
With increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective. At higher levels 
of warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation 
limits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. Maladaptation 
can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided by long-term planning and the 
implementation of adaptation actions that are ﬂexible, multi-sectoral and inclusive. (high conﬁdence)
The effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented 
for speciﬁc contexts, sectors and regions and will decrease with 
increasing warming (high conﬁdence)125. For example, common 
adaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and 
agronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop 
systems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of 
warming (high confidence). The effectiveness of most water-related 
adaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing 
warming (high confidence). Adaptations for hydropower and 
thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 
1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming 
(medium conﬁdence). Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to 
climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing 
global warming (high conﬁdence). Globally, adaptation options related 
to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, 
with a substantial increase in residual risk (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.5, WGII SPM C.2.10, 
WGII Figure TS.6 Panel (e), 4.7.2} 
With increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be 
reached and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the 
poorest vulnerable populations, will increase (high conﬁdence). 
Already below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation 
responses by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will increasingly 
face hard limits (high conﬁdence) (Section 2.1.2). Above 1.5°C, some 
ecosystem-based adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness 
in providing beneﬁts to people as these ecosystems will reach hard 
adaptation limits (high conﬁdence). Adaptation to address the risks of 
heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work 
for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become 
signiﬁcantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for 
regions with warm climates (high conﬁdence). Above 1.5°C global 
warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits 
for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt 
124 See Annex I: Glossary. Examples of compound extreme events are concurrent heatwaves and droughts or compound ﬂooding. {WGI SPM Footnote 18}
125 There are limitations to assessing the full scope of adaptation options available in the future since not all possible future adaptation responses can be incorporated in climate 
impact models, and projections of future adaptation depend on currently available technologies or approaches. {WGII 4.7.2}
(medium confidence). By 2°C, soft limits are projected for multiple 
staple crops, particularly in tropical regions (high conﬁdence). By 3°C, 
soft limits are projected for some water management measures for 
many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe (medium 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.3, WGII SPM C.3.4, WGII SPM C.3.5, 
WGII TS.D.2.2, WGII TS.D.2.3; SR1.5 SPM B.6; SROCC SPM C.1}
Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the 
effectiveness of adaptation. For example, inclusive, integrated 
and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national 
scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems 
and ﬁnancial and technological resources and capabilities foster 
urban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting 
adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning 
systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing that have 
broad applicability across sectors and provide greater beneﬁts to other 
adaptation options when combined. Transitioning from incremental to 
transformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, 
primarily in the ﬁnancial, governance, institutional and policy domains, 
can help overcome soft adaptation limits. However, adaptation does 
not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and 
before reaching soft and hard limits. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2, 
WGII SPM C.2.6, WGII SPM.C.2.13, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM.C.3.4, 
WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII Figure TS.6 Panel (e)}
Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of 
vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difﬁcult and expensive 
to change and exacerbate existing inequalities. Actions that focus 
on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead 
to maladaptation. Adaptation options can become maladaptive due 
to their environmental impacts that constrain ecosystem services and 
decrease biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change or by 
causing adverse outcomes for different groups, exacerbating inequity. 
Maladaptation can be avoided by ﬂexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive and

beneﬁts to many sectors and systems. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.4, 
WGII SPM.C.4.1, WGII SPM C.4.2, WGII SPM C.4.3}
Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge 
as it implies both dealing with slow onset changes and increases 
in the frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events (high 
conﬁdence). Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier 
under high rates of sea level rise (high conﬁdence). Responses to ongoing 
sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, 
advance and planned relocation (high conﬁdence). These responses 
are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, 
aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive 
community engagement processes (high conﬁdence). Ecosystem-based 
solutions such as wetlands provide co-beneﬁts for the environment 
and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for ﬂood defences (medium 
conﬁdence), but have site-speciﬁc physical limits, at least above 1.5ºC 
of global warming (high conﬁdence) and lose effectiveness at high 
rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5 to 1 cm yr-1 (medium conﬁdence). 
Seawalls can be maladaptive as they effectively reduce impacts in the 
short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate 
risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive 
plan (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM C.2.5; WGII SPM C.2.8, WGII SPM C.4.1;

Figure 3.4: Observed and projected global mean sea level change and its impacts, and time scales of coastal risk management. Panel (a): Global mean sea 
level change in metres relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 and for 
2150 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and median values and 
likely ranges are shown for the considered scenarios. Relative to 1995-2014, the likely global mean sea level rise by 2050 is between 0.15 to 0.23 m in the very low 
GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) and 0.20 to 0.29 m in the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); by 2100 between 0.28 to 0.55 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.63 to 1.01 m under 
SSP5-8.5; and by 2150 between 0.37 to 0.86 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.98 to 1.88 m under SSP5-8.5 (medium conﬁdence). Changes relative to 1900 are calculated by adding 0.158 
m (observed global mean sea level rise from 1900 to 1995-2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995-2014. The future changes to 2300 (bars) are based on literature assessment, 
representing the 17th–83rd percentile range for SSP1-2.6 (0.3 to 3.1 m) and SSP5-8.5 (1.7 to 6.8 m). Red dashed lines: Low-likelihood, high-impact storyline, including ice sheet 
instability processes. These indicate the potential impact of deeply uncertain processes, and show the 83rd percentile of SSP5-8.5 projections that include low-likelihood, high-
impact processes that cannot be ruled out; because of low conﬁdence in projections of these processes, this is not part of a likely range. IPCC AR6 global and regional sea level 
projections are hosted at https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool. The low-lying coastal zone is currently home to around 896 million people (nearly 11% of the 
2020 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050 across all ﬁve SSPs. Panel (b): Typical time scales for the planning, implementation (dashed bars) and 
operational lifetime of current coastal risk-management measures (blue bars). Higher rates of sea level rise demand earlier and stronger responses and reduce the lifetime of measures (inset). 
As the scale and pace of sea level rise accelerates beyond 2050, long-term adjustments may in some locations be beyond the limits of current adaptation options and for some small 
islands and low-lying coasts could be an existential risk. {WGI SPM B.5, WGI C.2.5, WGI Figure SPM.8, WGI 9.6; WGII SPM B.4.5, WGII B.5.2, WGII C.2.8, WGII D.3.3, WGII TS.D.7,

3.3 Mitigation Pathways
Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Pathways consistent 
with 1.5°C and 2°C carbon budgets imply rapid, deep, and in most cases immediate GHG emission reductions in 
all sectors (high conﬁdence). Exceeding a warming level and returning (i.e. overshoot) implies increased risks 
and potential irreversible impacts; achieving and sustaining global net negative CO2 emissions would reduce 
warming (high conﬁdence).
3.3.1 Remaining Carbon Budgets
Limiting global temperature increase to a speciﬁc level requires 
limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to within a ﬁnite carbon 
budget126, along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every 
1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises 
by likely 0.27°C to 0.63°C (best estimate of 0.45°C). This relationship 
implies that there is a ﬁnite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in 
order to limit warming to any given level. {WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.1.1; 
SR1.5 SPM C.1.3} (Figure 3.5)
The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget (RCB) from 
the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% 
likelihood127 is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C (67% likelihood) 
this is 1150 GtCO2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantiﬁed 
based on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of 
historical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from 
thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after 
global anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations 
in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation 
action. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the 
resulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the 
same level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting 
warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to 
600 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 warming129. Limiting warming to 2°C 
with a 67% (or 83%) likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 (900) GtCO2 
from the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, 
the RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO2130. {WGI SPM D.1.2, WGI Table SPM.2; 
WGIII Box SPM.1, WGIII Box 3.4; SR1.5 SPM C.1.3}
126 See Annex I: Glossary. 
127 This likelihood is based on the uncertainty in transient climate response to cumulative net CO2 emissions and additional Earth system feedbacks and provides the probability that 
global warming will not exceed the temperature levels speciﬁed. {WGI Table SPM.1}
128 Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Most countries report their anthropogenic 
land CO2 ﬂuxes including ﬂuxes due to human-caused environmental change (e.g., CO2 fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their National GHG inventories. Using emissions 
estimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {WGIII SPM Footnote 9, WGIII TS.3, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 6}
129 The central case RCB assumes future non-CO2 warming (the net additional contribution of aerosols and non-CO2 GHG) of around 0.1°C above 2010–2019 in line with stringent 
mitigation scenarios. If additional non-CO2 warming is higher, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood shrinks to around 300 GtCO2. If, however, additional 
non-CO2 warming is limited to only 0.05°C (via stronger reductions of CH4 and N2O through a combination of deep structural and behavioural changes, e.g., dietary changes), 
the RCB could be around 600 GtCO2 for 1.5°C warming. {WGI Table SPM.2, WGI Box TS.7; WGIII Box 3.4}
130 When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, these RCB estimates are similar to SR1.5 but larger than AR5 values due to methodological improvements. {WGI SPM D.1.3}
131 Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the speciﬁc calculated fractions. 
132 See footnote 131. 
133 These projected adjustments of carbon sinks to stabilisation or decline of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are accounted for in calculations of remaining carbon budgets. 
{WGI SPM footnote 32}
If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, 
at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would 
almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and 
exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C 
(67%) (Figure 3.5). Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative 
net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 (2400 ±240 GtCO2) amount 
to about four-ﬁfths131 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of 
limiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO2) and 
to about two-thirds132 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability 
to limit global warming to 2°C (central estimate about 3550 GtCO2). 
{WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Table 2.1}
In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the land and ocean 
carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the 
accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere (high conﬁdence). While 
natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute 
terms, a progressively larger amount of CO2 under higher compared to 
lower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the 
proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with 
increasing cumulative net CO2 emissions (high conﬁdence). Additional 
ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, 
such as GHG ﬂuxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildﬁres, 
would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere 
(high conﬁdence). In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and 
decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less 
carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations (high 
conﬁdence) and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low 
GHG emissions scenario (medium confidence)133. {WGI SPM B.4,

Table 3.1: Key characteristics of the modelled global emissions pathways. Summary of projected CO2 and GHG emissions, projected net zero timings and the resulting global 
warming outcomes. Pathways are categorised (columns), according to their likelihood of limiting warming to different peak warming levels (if peak temperature occurs before 2100) 
and 2100 warming levels. Values shown are for the median [p50] and 5–95th percentiles [p5–p95], noting that not all pathways achieve net zero CO2 or GHGs. {WGIII Table SPM.2}
1 Detailed explanations on the Table are provided in WGIII Box SPM.1 and WGIII Table SPM.2. The relationship between the temperature categories and SSP/RCPs is discussed 
in Cross-Section Box.2. Values in the table refer to the 50th and [5–95th] percentile values across the pathways falling within a given category as deﬁned in WGIII Box SPM.1. 
The three dots (…) sign denotes that the value cannot be given (as the value is after 2100 or, for net zero, net zero is not reached). Based on the assessment of climate emulators 
in AR6 WG I (Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators were used for the probabilistic assessment of the resulting warming of the pathways. For the ‘Temperature Change’ 
and ‘Likelihood’ columns, the non-bracketed values represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming 
estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges in the “likelihood” column, the median warming for every pathway in that category 
is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators (MAGICC and FaIR). These ranges cover both the uncertainty of the emissions pathways as well as the climate 
emulators’ uncertainty. All global warming levels are relative to 1850-1900. 
2 C3 pathways are sub-categorised according to the timing of policy action to match the emissions pathways in WGIII Figure SPM.4.

3.3.2 Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications
From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused 
global warming to a speciﬁc level requires limiting cumulative 
CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, 
along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions 
(see Cross-Section Box.1). Global modelled pathways that reach 
and sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in 
a gradual decline in surface temperature (high conﬁdence). 
Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in 
CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative 
CO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to 
achieve net negative CO2 emissions135. Achieving global net zero 
CO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO2 emissions balanced by 
durably stored CO2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to 
stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase (see 3.3.3) 
(high conﬁdence). This is different from achieving net zero GHG 
emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions (see 
Cross-Section Box.1) equal CO2 removal (high conﬁdence). Emissions 
pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions deﬁned by the 
100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions 
and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature 
after an earlier peak (high conﬁdence). While reaching net zero CO2 or net 
zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross 
emissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hard-
to-abate residual emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, 
aviation, shipping, and industrial processes) is unavoidable (high 
conﬁdence). {WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.1.1, WGI SPM D.1.8; WGIII SPM C.2, 
WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM C.11, WGIII Box TS.6; SR1.5 SPM A.2.2}
In modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, 
followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several 
variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation 
strategy and the gases covered (high conﬁdence). Global net zero 
CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit 
warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, and around 
the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%). While 
non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit 
warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O 
and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2-eq yr-1 remain at the time of 
134 Net zero GHG emissions deﬁned by the 100-year global warming potential. See footnote 70.
135 See Section 3.3.3 and 3.4.1.
net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. 
 
As a result, net zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs 
(high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.2, WGIII SPM C.2.3, WGIII SPM C.2.4, 
WGIII Table SPM.2, WGIII 3.3} (Figure 3.6) 
the global emissions reported in WGIII SPM Section B and WGIII Chapter 2; this ensures internal consistency in assumptions about emission sources and activities, as well as 
consistency with temperature projections based on the physical climate science assessment by WGI (see WGIII SPM Footnote 49). Negative values (e.g., in C5, C6) represent 
an increase in emissions. The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55 [53–58] GtCO2-eq, thus within the uncertainty ranges of estimates for 2019 emissions [53-66] GtCO2-eq 
(see 2.1.1). 
4 Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year time-step data of the modelled pathways. Ranges in square 
brackets underneath refer to the range across the pathways, comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile 5-year interval and the upper bound of the 95th percentile 
5-year interval. Numbers in round brackets signify the fraction of pathways that reach speciﬁc milestones over the 21st century. Percentiles reported across all pathways in 
that category include those that do not reach net zero before 2100.
5 For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are inﬁlled and aggregated into a Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO2-eq deﬁned by the 100-year 
global warming potential. For each pathway, reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions was the minimum required for the assessment of the climate response and the assignment 
to a climate category. Emissions pathways without climate assessment are not included in the ranges presented here. See WGIII Annex III.II.5. 
6 Cumulative emissions are calculated from the start of 2020 to the time of net zero and 2100, respectively. They are based on harmonised net CO2 emissions, ensuring 
consistency with the WG I assessment of the remaining carbon budget. {WGIII Box 3.4, WGIII SPM Footnote 50}

3.3.3 Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation
All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or 
lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate 
GHG emissions reductions in all sectors (see also 4.1, 4.5). Reductions 
in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas 
can be achieved through a combination of energy efﬁciency and 
conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy 
carriers (see also 4.5, Figure 4.4). Socio-cultural options and behavioural 
change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most 
of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved 
136 CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO2 is captured directly from the 
atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for 
gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it 
is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which is more than the CO2 storage requirements through 
2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and 
managed, it is estimated that the CO2 can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological 
environmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. Enabling 
conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM C.4.6}
infrastructure design and access. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM C.3, 
WGIII SPM C.5, WGIII SPM C.6, WGIII SPM C.7.3, WGIII SPM C.8, 
WGIII SPM C.10.2} 
Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and 
GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon 
energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, 
demand-side measures and improving efﬁciency, reducing 
non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR136. In global modelled pathways 
that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied

Section 3
from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or 
fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased 
electriﬁcation of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service 
demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy 
efﬁciency and behavioural changes and increased electriﬁcation of 
energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 
1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot generally implement such 
changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C (>67%). 
(high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM C.3.2, WGIII SPM C.4, 
WGIII TS.4.2; SR1.5 SPM C.2.2}
AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can 
deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 
removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs 
may result from the impacts of climate change, competing 
demands on land, conﬂicts with food security and livelihoods, 
the complexity of land ownership and management systems, 
and cultural aspects (see 3.4.1). All assessed modelled pathways 
that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 include land-based 
mitigation and land-use change, with most including different 
combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and 
bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at 
risk from future loss (or sink reversal) triggered by climate change and 
disturbances such as ﬂood, drought, ﬁre, or pest outbreaks, or future 
poor management. (high conﬁdence) {WGI SPM B.4.3; WGII SPM B.2.3, 
WGII SPM B.5.4; WGIII SPM C.9, WGIII SPM C.11.3, WGIII SPM D.2.3, 
WGIII TS.4.2, 3.4; SR1.5 SPM C.2.5; SRCCL SPM B.1.4, SRCCL SPM B.3, 
SRCCL SPM B.7}
In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, 
CDR can fulﬁl three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 
or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing 
‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions (e.g., some emissions from 
agriculture, aviation, shipping, industrial processes) to help reach 
net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative 
CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual 
residual emissions (high conﬁdence). CDR methods vary in terms 
of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage 
medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-beneﬁts, impacts and risks, and 
governance requirements (high conﬁdence). Speciﬁcally, maturity 
ranges from lower maturity (e.g., ocean alkalinisation) to higher 
maturity (e.g., reforestation); removal and storage potential ranges 
from lower potential (<1 Gt CO2 yr-1, e.g., blue carbon management) 
to higher potential (>3 Gt CO2 yr-1, e.g., agroforestry); costs range from 
lower cost (e.g., –45 to 100 USD tCO2-1 for soil carbon sequestration) 
to higher cost (e.g., 100 to 300 USD tCO2-1 for direct air carbon dioxide 
capture and storage) (medium conﬁdence). Estimated storage timescales 
vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in 
vegetation and through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years 
or more for methods that store carbon in geological formations (high 
conﬁdence). Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, 
agroforestry and soil carbon sequestration are currently the only widely 
practiced CDR methods (high conﬁdence). Methods and levels of CDR 
deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on 
assumptions about costs, availability and constraints (high conﬁdence). 
{WGIII SPM C.3.5, WGIII SPM C.11.1, WGIII SPM C.11.4}
137 Limited overshoot refers to exceeding 1.5°C global warming by up to about 0.1°C, high overshoot by 0.1°C to 0.3°C, in both cases for up to several decades. {WGIII Box SPM.1}
3.3.4 Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other 
Implications
Exceeding a speciﬁc remaining carbon budget results in 
higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative 
global CO2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature 
exceedance (high conﬁdence). Continued reductions in emissions of 
short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature 
has been reached, would also further reduce warming (high conﬁdence). 
Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways 
limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) without overshoot. {WGI SPM D.1.1, 
WGI SPM D.1.6, WGI SPM D.1.7; WGIII TS.4.2}
Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some 
irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems 
compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing 
with the magnitude and duration of overshoot (high conﬁdence). 
Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies and ecosystems 
would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic 
impact-drivers, such as extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with 
increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, and 
associated livelihoods (high conﬁdence). Overshooting 1.5°C will result 
in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, 
such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet 
melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level 
rise (high conﬁdence). Overshoot increases the risks of severe impacts, 
such as increased wildﬁres, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, 
thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such 
impacts could increase releases of GHGs making temperature reversal 
more challenging (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM C.2, WGI SPM C.2.1, 
WGI SPM C.2.3; WGII SPM B.6, WGII SPM B.6.1, WGII SPM B.6.2; SR1.5 3.6}
The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed 
to return to a given warming level (high conﬁdence). Reducing global 
temperature by removing CO2 would require net negative emissions of 
220 GtCO2 (best estimate, with a likely range of 160 to 370 GtCO2) 
for every tenth of a degree (medium conﬁdence). Modelled pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot reach 
median values of cumulative net negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 
by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after high 
overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2 (high conﬁdence).137 
More rapid reduction in CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly 
methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement 
for net negative CO2 emissions and CDR, thereby reducing feasibility 
and sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks (high 
confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.1; WGIII SPM B.6.4, WGIII SPM C.2,

3.4.1 Synergies and trade-offs, costs and beneﬁts
Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and 
trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development 
(see also Section 4.6, Figure 4.4). Synergies and trade-offs depend 
on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context 
including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice. The 
potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options 
decreases as climate change intensiﬁes (see also Sections 3.2, 3.3.3, 
4.5). (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII Figure SPM.4b; WGIII SPM D.1,

In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems will have 
multiple co-beneﬁts, including improvements in air quality and health. 
There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, 
for instance, energy efﬁciency and renewable energy. (high conﬁdence) 
{WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII SPM D.1.3}
For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management 
options and demand-side response options (e.g., dietary choices, 
reduced post-harvest losses, reduced food waste) can contribute to 
eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health 
and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and life on land (medium 
confidence). In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote 
intensification of production, such as irrigation, may have negative 
effects on sustainability (e.g., for biodiversity, ecosystem services, 
groundwater depletion, and water quality) (high confidence). {WGII 
TS.D.5.5; WGIII SPM D.10; SRCCL SPM B.2.3}
Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, 
peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management are 
examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem 
functions, employment and local livelihoods, depending on context139. 
However, afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy 
with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse 
socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, 
food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land 
tenure is insecure. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM B.5.4, WGII SPM C.2.4; 
WGIII SPM C.11.2; SR1.5 SPM C.3.4, SR1.5 SPM C.3.5; SRCCL SPM B.3, 
SRCCL SPM B.7.3, SRCCL Figure SPM.3}
139 The impacts, risks, and co-beneﬁts of CDR deployment for ecosystems, biodiversity and people will be highly variable depending on the method, site-speciﬁc context, 
implementation and scale (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.11.2}
140 The evidence is too limited to make a similar robust conclusion for limiting warming to 1.5°C. {WGIII SPM footnote 68}
Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efﬁciently or shift 
global development towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such 
as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, and have 
the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development 
(high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.3.6; SR1.5 SPM D.4.2} 
Strengthening climate change mitigation action entails more 
rapid transitions and higher up-front investments, but brings 
beneﬁts from avoiding damages from climate change and 
reduced adaptation costs. The aggregate effects of climate change 
mitigation on global GDP (excluding damages from climate change and 
adaptation costs) are small compared to global projected GDP growth. 
Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages and 
the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming level. 
(high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM B.4.6, WGII TS.C.10; WGIII SPM C.12.2, 
WGIII SPM C.12.3} 
Cost-beneﬁt analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all 
damages from climate change, including non-monetary damages, 
or to capture the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of 
catastrophic damages (high conﬁdence). Even without accounting for 
these factors or for the co-beneﬁts of mitigation, the global beneﬁts 
of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation (medium 
conﬁdence). This ﬁnding is robust against a wide range of assumptions 
about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time 
(medium conﬁdence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C 
would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the beneﬁts 
in terms of reduced impacts and related risks (see 3.1.1, 3.1.2) and 
reduced adaptation needs (high confidence)140. {WGII SPM B.4, WGII 
SPM B.6; WGIII SPM C.12, WGIII SPM C.12.2, WGIII SPM C.12.3 WGIII Box TS.7; 
SR1.5 SPM B.3, SR1.5 SPM B.5, SR1.5 SPM B.6}
Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the 
potentially strong economic beneﬁts on human health from air quality 
improvement, may enhance the estimated beneﬁts of mitigation 
(medium conﬁdence). The economic effects of strengthened mitigation 
action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic 
structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of 
international cooperation (high conﬁdence). Ambitious mitigation 
pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic 
structure, with implications for near-term actions (Section 4.2), equity 
(Section 4.4), sustainability (Section 4.6), and ﬁnance (Section 4.8) 
(high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM C.12.2, WGIII SPM D.3.2, WGIII TS.4.2}
3.4 Long-Term Interactions Between Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development
Mitigation and adaptation can lead to synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development (high conﬁdence). 
Accelerated and equitable mitigation and adaptation bring beneﬁts from avoiding damages from climate 
change and are critical to achieving sustainable development (high conﬁdence). Climate resilient development138 
pathways are progressively constrained by every increment of further warming (very high conﬁdence). There is a 
rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all (very high conﬁdence).

Long-Term Climate and Development Futures
Section 3
3.4.2 Advancing Integrated Climate Action for Sustainable 
Development
An inclusive, equitable approach to integrating adaptation, mitigation 
and development can advance sustainable development in the long 
term (high conﬁdence). Integrated responses can harness synergies for 
sustainable development and reduce trade-offs (high conﬁdence). Shifting 
development pathways towards sustainability and advancing climate 
resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society 
and the private sector make development choices that prioritise risk 
reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-making processes, 
ﬁnance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors 
and timeframes (very high conﬁdence) (see also Figure 4.2). Inclusive 
processes involving local knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge 
increase these prospects (high conﬁdence). However, opportunities 
for action differ substantially among and within regions, driven by 
historical and ongoing patterns of development (very high conﬁdence). 
Accelerated ﬁnancial support for developing countries is critical to enhance 
mitigation and adaptation action (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.5.4, 
WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM D.1.1, WGII SPM D.1.2, WGII SPM D.2, 
WGII SPM D.3, WGII SPM D.5, WGII SPM D.5.1, WGII SPM D.5.2; 
WGIII SPM D.1, WGIII SPM D.2, WGIII SPM D.2.4, WGIII SPM E.2.2, 
WGIII SPM E.2.3, WGIII SPM E.5.3, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 5} 
Policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability 
can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation and adaptation 
responses (medium conﬁdence). Combining mitigation with action 
to shift development pathways, such as broader sectoral policies, 
approaches that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, ﬁnancial 
regulation, or macroeconomic policies can overcome barriers and 
open up a broader range of mitigation options (high conﬁdence). 
Integrated, inclusive planning and investment in everyday decision-
making about urban infrastructure can signiﬁcantly increase the 
adaptive capacity of urban and rural settlements. Coastal cities and 
settlements play an important role in advancing climate resilient 
development due to the high number of people living in the Low 
Elevation Coastal Zone, the escalating and climate compounded risk 
that they face, and their vital role in national economies and beyond 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM.D.3, WGII SPM D.3.3; WGIII SPM E.2, 
WGIII SPM E.2.2; SR1.5 SPM D.6}
Observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, 
projected risks, trends in vulnerability, and adaptation limits 
demonstrate that transformation for sustainability and climate 
resilient development action is more urgent than previously 
assessed (very high conﬁdence). Climate resilient development 
integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance 
sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development 
pathways have been constrained by past development, emissions and 
climate change and are progressively constrained by every increment 
of warming, in particular beyond 1.5°C (very high conﬁdence). 
Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions 
and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 2°C (medium conﬁdence). 
Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate 
resilient development, but biodiversity and ecosystem services have 
limited capacity to adapt to increasing global warming levels, making 
climate resilient development progressively harder to achieve beyond 
1.5°C warming (very high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM D.1.1, 
WGII SPM D.4, WGII SPM D.4.3, WGII SPM D.5.1; WGIII SPM D.1.1} 
The cumulative scientiﬁc evidence is unequivocal: climate change 
is a threat to human well-being and planetary health (very 
high conﬁdence). Any further delay in concerted anticipatory 
global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and 
rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and 
sustainable future for all (very high conﬁdence). Opportunities for 
near-term action are assessed in the following section. {WGII SPM D.5.3;

4.1 The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action
The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks 
depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions 
(very high conﬁdence). Global warming is more likely than not to reach 
1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission 
scenarios (SSP1-1.9), and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under 
higher emissions scenarios141. Many adaptation options have medium 
or high feasibility up to 1.5°C (medium to high conﬁdence, depending 
on option), but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached 
in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce 
climate risk will decrease with increasing warming (high conﬁdence). 
Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the 
extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or 
lower climate resilient development (high conﬁdence). Climate resilient 
development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse 
gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming 
is exceeded in the near term (high conﬁdence). Without urgent, effective 
and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change 
increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around 
the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse 
consequences for current and future generations (high conﬁdence).

Box.2, Figure 2.1, Figure 2.3)
141 In the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under 
the intermediate and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely 
than not to be reached under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). The best estimates [and very likely ranges] of global warming for the different scenarios in the 
near term are: 1.5 [1.2 to 1.7]°C (SSP1-1.9); 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]°C (SSP1-2.6); 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]°C (SSP2-4.5); 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]°C (SSP3-7.0); and 1.6[1.3 to 1.9]°C (SSP5-8.5).

144 These numbers for CO2 are 48 [36 to 69]% in 2030, 65 [50 to 96] % in 2035, 80 [61 to109] % in 2040 and 99 [79 to 119]% in 2050.
145 These numbers for CO2 are 22 [1 to 44]% in 2030, 37 [21 to 59] % in 2035, 51 [36 to 70] % in 2040 and 73 [55 to 90]% in 2050.
146 In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted throughout the life 
cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO2 from power plants, or 50 to 80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply. {WGIII SPM footnote 54}
In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with 
no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 
2°C (>67%), assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions 
are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and 
deep GHG emissions reductions (high conﬁdence) 142. In pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, net 
global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 
2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 
and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 (high conﬁdence) (Section 2.3.1, Table 2.2, 
Figure 2.5, Table 3.1)144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming 
to 2°C (>67%) have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels 
of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] 
% by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145 (high conﬁdence). Global 
GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would 
make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C (high conﬁdence) 
and limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) would then imply a rapid 
acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 
70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (medium conﬁdence) (Section 2.3.1) 
Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure146 and 
limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives 
prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase 
feasibility risks (high confidence). {WGIII SPM B.6.3, WGIII 3.5.2, 
WGIII SPM B.6, WGIII SPM B.6., WGIII SPM C.1, WGIII SPM C1.1, 
WGIII Table SPM.2} (Cross-Section Box.2)
Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation reduces the risks of climate 
change for humans and ecosystems. In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited 
overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) and assume immediate action, global GHG emissions 
are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep reductions. As adaptation options often have 
long implementation times, accelerated implementation of adaptation, particularly in this decade, is important 
to close adaptation gaps. (high conﬁdence)

Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate
Section 4
All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) 
or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO2 emissions 
and non-CO2 emissions (see Figure 3.6) (high confidence). 
For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) 
with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 (methane) emissions are 
reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 
44 [31 to 63]% in 2040 (high confidence). Global CH4 emissions 
are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 
37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 
2°C with action starting in 2020 (>67%) (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM 
C1.2, WGIII Table SPM.2, WGIII 3.3; SR1.5 SPM C.1, SR1.5 SPM C.1.2} 
(Cross-Section Box.2)
All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) 
or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors 
(high conﬁdence). The contributions of different sectors vary across 
modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation 
pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via 
reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply 
sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry 
and transport sectors (Figure 4.1). Strategies can rely on combinations 
of different options (Figure 4.1, Section 4.5), but doing less in one 
sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if 
warming is to be limited. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM 
C.3.1, WGIII SPM 3.2, WGIII SPM C.3.3} (Cross-Section Box.2)
Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated 
adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to 
increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, 
SIDS, Central and South America147, Asia and the Arctic, and will 
disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations (high 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII SPM B.2.4, WGII 12.2, WGII 10.

4.2 Beneﬁts of Strengthening Near-Term Action
Figure 4.1: Sectoral emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C. Panel (a) shows sectoral CO2 and non-CO2 emissions in global modelled pathways that limit 
warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. The horizontal lines illustrate halving 2015 emissions (base year of the pathways) (dashed) and reaching net zero emissions 
(solid line). The range shows the 5–95th percentile of the emissions across the pathways. The timing strongly differs by sector, with the CO2 emissions from the electricity/fossil fuel 
industries sector and land-use change generally reaching net zero earlier. Non-CO2 emissions from agriculture are also substantially reduced compared to pathways without climate 
policy but do not typically reach zero. Panel (b) Although all pathways include strongly reduced emissions, there are different pathways as indicated by the illustrative mitigation 
pathways used in IPCC WGIII. The pathways emphasise routes consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C with a high reliance on net negative emissions (IMP-Neg), high resource 
efﬁciency (IMP-LD), a focus on sustainable development (IMP-SP) or renewables (IMP-Ren) and consistent with 2°C based on a less rapid introduction of mitigation measures followed 
by a subsequent gradual strengthening (IMP-GS). Positive (solid ﬁlled bars) and negative emissions (hatched bars) for different illustrative mitigation pathways are compared to 
GHG emissions from the year 2019. The category “energy supply (including electricity)” includes bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and direct air carbon capture and storage. 
{WGIII Box TS.5, WGIII 3.3, WGIII 3.4, WGIII 6.6, WGIII 10.3, WGIII 11.3} (Cross-Section Box.2)
Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially 
for vulnerable populations. Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs 
and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-beneﬁts, avoid locking-in emission sources, 
and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes. These near-term actions involve higher up-front 
investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by a range of enabling conditions and removal or 
reduction of barriers to feasibility. (high conﬁdence)
Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will bring 
beneﬁts to human well-being (high conﬁdence) (Section 4.3).  As 
adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term 
planning and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, is 
important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints remain 
for some regions. The beneﬁts to vulnerable populations would be high 
(see Section 4.4). (high conﬁdence) {WGI SPM B.1, WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI 
SPM B.2.2, WGI SPM B.3; WGII SPM C.1.1, WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM 
C.2, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII Figure SPM.4b; SROCC SPM C.3.4, SROCC 
Figure 3.4, SROCC Figure SPM.5}
Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C 
would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related 
to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared 
to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all (very 
high conﬁdence). The magnitude and rate of climate change and 
associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation 
actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages 
escalate with every increment of global warming (very high conﬁdence). 
Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming which 
will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including 
Ecosystem-based Adaptation and many water-related options, as well 
as increasing mitigation feasibility risks, such as for options based on 
ecosystems (high conﬁdence).  Comprehensive, effective, and innovative 
responses integrating adaptation and mitigation can harness synergies 
and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, as well as in 
meeting requirements for ﬁnancing (very high conﬁdence) (see Section 
4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9). {WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4, WGII SPM B.6.2,

SR1.5 D.1.3, SR1.5 D.5.2}
Mitigation actions will have other sustainable development 
co-beneﬁts (high conﬁdence). Mitigation will improve air quality and 
human health in the near term notably because many air pollutants are 
148 In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted throughout the life 
cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO2 from power plants, or 50 to 80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply. {WGIII SPM footnote 54}
co-emitted by GHG emitting sectors and because methane emissions 
leads to surface ozone formation (high conﬁdence). The beneﬁts from 
air quality improvement include prevention of air pollution-related 
premature deaths, chronic diseases and damages to ecosystems 
and crops. The economic beneﬁts for human health from air quality 
improvement arising from mitigation action can be of the same order 
of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger (medium 
conﬁdence). As methane has a short lifetime but is a potent GHG, 
strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit 
near-term warming and improve air quality by reducing global surface 
ozone (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI SPM D.2.2, WGI 6.7,

WGII 5 ES, WGII 7 ES; WGII 7.3.1.2; WGIII Figure SPM.8, WGIII SPM 
C.2.3, WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII TS.4.2}
Challenges from delayed adaptation and mitigation actions 
include the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, 
stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness 
of adaptation and mitigation options (high conﬁdence). The 
continued installation of unabated fossil fuel148 infrastructure 
will ‘lock-in’ GHG emissions (high conﬁdence). Limiting global 
warming to 2°C or below will leave a substantial amount of fossil fuels 
unburned and could strand considerable fossil fuel infrastructure 
(high confidence), with globally discounted value projected to be 
around USD 1 to 4 trillion from 2015 to 2050 (medium conﬁdence). 
Early actions would limit the size of these stranded assets, whereas 
delayed actions with continued investments in unabated high-emitting 
infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting 
alternatives prior to 2030 would raise future stranded assets to the 
higher end of the range – thereby acting as barriers and increasing 
political economy feasibility risks that may jeopardise efforts to limit 
global warming. (high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.6.3, WGIII SPM C.4,

Section 4
Scaling-up near-term climate actions (Section 4.1) will mobilise a 
mix of low-cost and high-cost options. High-cost options, as in energy 
and infrastructure, are needed to avoid future lock-ins, foster innovation 
and initiate transformational changes (Figure 4.4). Climate resilient 
development pathways in support of sustainable development for all are 
shaped by equity, and social and climate justice (very high conﬁdence). 
Embedding effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation in 
development planning can reduce vulnerability, conserve and restore 
ecosystems, and enable climate resilient development. This is especially 
challenging in localities with persistent development gaps and limited 
resources. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.5, WGII SPM D1; WGIII TS.5.2,

Scaling-up climate action may generate disruptive changes in 
economic structure with distributional consequences and need 
to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, within 
and between countries. Deeper ﬁscal, ﬁnancial, institutional and 
regulatory reforms can offset such adverse effects and unlock mitigation 
potentials. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade will 
determine the extent to which medium and long-term development 
pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development 
outcomes. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.5, WGII Box TS.8; 
WGIII SPM D.3, WGIII SPM E.2, WGIII SPM E.3, WGIII SPM E.4, WGIII TS.2, 
WGIII TS.4.1, WGIII TS.6.4, WGIII 15.2, WGIII 15.6}
Enabling conditions would need to be strengthened in the near-
term and barriers reduced or removed to realise opportunities 
for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and 
climate resilient development (high conﬁdence) (Figure 4.2). 
These enabling conditions are differentiated by national, regional 
and local circumstances and geographies, according to capabilities, 
and include: equity and inclusion in climate action (see Section 4.4), 
rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and system (see Section 
4.5), measures to achieve synergies and reduce trade-
offs with sustainable development goals (see Section 4.6), 
governance and policy improvements (see Section 4.7), access 
to finance, improved international cooperation and technology 
improvements (see Section 4.8), and integration of near-term 
actions across sectors, systems and regions (see Section 4.9). 
{WGII SPM D.2; WGIII SPM E.1, WGIII SPM E.2}
Barriers to feasibility would need to be reduced or removed 
to deploy mitigation and adaptation options at scale. Many 
limits to feasibility and effectiveness of responses can be overcome 
by addressing a range of barriers, including economic, technological, 
institutional, social, environmental and geophysical barriers. The 
feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, 
multi-sectoral solutions that differentiate responses based on climate 
risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. Strengthened 
near-term actions in modelled cost-effective pathways that limit global 
warming to 2°C or lower, reduce the overall risk to the feasibility of the 
system transitions, compared to modelled pathways with delayed or 
uncoordinated action. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.3, 
WGII SPM C.5; WGIII SPM E.1, WGIII SPM E.1.3}
Integrating ambitious climate actions with macroeconomic 
policies under global uncertainty would provide benefits 
(high confidence). This encompasses three main directions: 
(a) economy-wide mainstreaming packages supporting options to 
improved sustainable low-emission economic recovery, development 
and job creation programs (Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9) (b) safety 
nets and social protection in the transition (Section 4.4, 4.7); and 
(c) broadened access to ﬁnance, technology and capacity-building 
and coordinated support to low-emission infrastructure (‘leap-frog’ 
potential), especially in developing regions, and under debt stress 
(high conﬁdence). (Section 4.8) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.4.1,

Figure 4.2: The illustrative development pathways (red to green) and associated outcomes (right panel) show that there is a rapidly narrowing window of 
opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Climate resilient development is the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation 
measures to support sustainable development. Diverging pathways illustrate that interacting choices and actions made by diverse government, private sector and civil society actors 
can advance climate resilient development, shift pathways towards sustainability, and enable lower emissions and adaptation. Diverse knowledges and values include cultural values, 
Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientiﬁc knowledge. Climatic and non-climatic events, such as droughts, ﬂoods or pandemics, pose more severe shocks to pathways 
with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) than to pathways with higher climate resilient development (green). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity 
for some human and natural systems at global warming of 1.5°C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The development pathways taken by 
countries at all stages of economic development impact GHG emissions and hence shape mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. 
Pathways and opportunities for action are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed, dashed pathway), and enabling and constraining conditions 
(left panel), and take place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. The longer emissions reductions are delayed, the fewer effective 
adaptation options. {WGI SPM B.1; WGII SPM B.1 to B.5, WGII SPM C.2 to 5, WGII SPM D.1 to 5, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII Figure SPM.4, WGII Figure SPM.5, WGII TS.D.5, WGII 3.1,

4.3 Near-Term Risks
Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing 
global warming (high conﬁdence). Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased 
compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difﬁcult to manage (high conﬁdence). Losses and damages 
will increase with increasing global warming (very high conﬁdence), while strongly concentrated among the 
poorest vulnerable populations (high conﬁdence). Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns 
would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards (high conﬁdence).
98
Section 4
Section 1
Section 4
Global warming will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) 
mainly due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions in nearly all 
considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every 
region in the world is projected to face further increases in 
climate hazards (medium to high conﬁdence, depending on 
region and hazard), increasing multiple risks to ecosystems 
and humans (very high conﬁdence). In the near term, natural 
variability149 will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating 
or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little 
effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important 
to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any 
single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced 
trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature 
in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a 
probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed 
in WGI (medium confidence). The occurrence of individual years with 
global surface temperature change above a certain level does not 
imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large 
explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term150 , it 
would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change 
by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially 
over land, for one to three years (medium conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B.1.3, 
WGI SPM B.1.4, WGI SPM C.1, WGI SPM C.2, WGI Cross-Section Box TS.1, 
WGI Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.3.1; 
WGIII Box SPM.1 Figure 1}
The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term 
trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic 
development and adaptation (high conﬁdence). In the near term, 
many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend 
more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure 
than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios 
(high conﬁdence). Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing 
globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing 
inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure 
(high conﬁdence). Urbanisation increases hot extremes (very high 
conﬁdence) and precipitation runoff intensity (high conﬁdence). 
Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major 
driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverﬂow events and sea level 
rise hazards, increasing risks (high conﬁdence) (Figure 4.3). Vulnerability 
will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and 
atolls in the context of sea level rise (high conﬁdence) (see Figure 3.4 and 
Figure 4.3). Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements 
and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural 
areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on 
climate-sensitive livelihoods (high conﬁdence). Human and ecosystem 
vulnerability are interdependent (high conﬁdence). Vulnerability to 
climate change for ecosystems will be strongly inﬂuenced by past, 
present, and future patterns of human development, including from 
unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic 
pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of 
149 See Annex I: Glossary. The main internal variability phenomena include El Niño–Southern Oscillation, Paciﬁc Decadal Variability and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability through 
their regional influence. The internal variability of global surface temperature in any single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5 to 95% range, high confidence).

land, ocean, and water (high conﬁdence). Several near-term risks can 
be moderated with adaptation (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM C.2.6; 
WGII SPM B.2, WGII SPM B.2.3, WGII SPM B.2.5, WGII SPM B.3, 
WGII SPM B.3.2, WGII TS.C.5.2} (Section 4.5 and 3.2)
Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near term 
(at 1.5°C global warming) are:
• Increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes and dangerous 
heat-humidity conditions, with increased human mortality, morbidity, 
and labour productivity loss (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B.2.2, 
WGI TS Figure TS.6; WGII SPM B.1.4, WGII SPM B.4.4, 
WGII Figure SPM.2} 
• Increasing frequency of marine heatwaves will increase risks 
of biodiversity loss in the oceans, including from mass mortality 
events (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM B.2.3; WGII SPM B.1.2, 
WGII Figure SPM.2; SROCC SPM B.5.1}
• Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in 
forest ecosystems (medium conﬁdence) and kelp and seagrass 
ecosystems (high to very high conﬁdence) and are high to very 
high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems (high conﬁdence) 
and warm-water coral reefs (very high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.3.1} 
• More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated ﬂooding 
in many regions including coastal and other low-lying cities 
(medium to high conﬁdence), and increased proportion of and 
peak wind speeds of intense tropical cyclones (high conﬁdence). 
{WGI SPM B.2.4, WGI SPM C.2.2, WGI SPM C.2.6, WGI 11.7} 
• High risks from dryland water scarcity, wildﬁre damage, and 
permafrost degradation (medium conﬁdence). {SRCCL SPM A.5.3.}
• Continued sea level rise and increased frequency and 
magnitude of extreme sea level events encroaching on coastal 
human settlements and damaging coastal infrastructure (high 
conﬁdence), committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to 
submergence and loss (medium conﬁdence), expanding land 
salinization (very high conﬁdence), with cascading to risks to 
livelihoods, health, well-being, cultural values, food and water 
security (high conﬁdence). {WGI SPM C.2.5, WGI SPM C.2.6; 
WGII SPM B.3.1, WGII SPM B.5.2; SRCCL SPM A.5.6; SROCC SPM B.3.4, 
SROCC SPM 3.6, SROCC SPM B.9.1} (Figure 3.4, 4.3)
• Climate change will signiﬁcantly increase ill health and premature 
deaths from the near to long term (high conﬁdence). Further 
warming will increase climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, 
and vector-borne disease risks (high conﬁdence), and mental health 
challenges including anxiety and stress (very high conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM B.4.4}

Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate
Section 4
• Cryosphere-related changes in ﬂoods, landslides, and water 
availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for 
people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII TS C.4.2}
• The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy 
precipitation (high conﬁdence) will increase rain-generated local 
ﬂooding (medium conﬁdence). {WGI Figure SPM.6, WGI SPM B.2.2; 
WGII TS C.4.5}
Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and 
cascade in the near term (high conﬁdence). Many regions are 
projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound 
events with higher global warming (high conﬁdence) including 
concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food 
production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden 
food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heat-
induced labour productivity losses (high conﬁdence) (Figure 4.3). These 
interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, 
and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality 
with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions (high 
conﬁdence). Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to 
food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make 
these risks more severe and more difﬁcult to manage, including when 
interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land 
between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics (high 
conﬁdence). Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and 
long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples 
and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to 
meet basic needs (high conﬁdence). Increasing transboundary risks 
are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts 
from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, 
markets, and natural resource ﬂows (high conﬁdence) and may interact 
with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from 
some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including 
risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions 
reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of 
naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding 
climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and 
livelihoods (high conﬁdence) (see Section 3.4.1 and 4.5). {WGI SPM.2.7; 
WGII SPM B.2.1, WGII SPM B.5, WGII SPM B.5.1, WGII SPM B.5.2, 
WGII SPM B.5.3, WGII SPM B.5.4, WGII Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7; 
WGIII SPM C.11.2; SRCCL SPM A.5, SRCCL SPM A.6.5} (Figure 4.3)
With every increment of global warming losses and damages will 
increase (very high conﬁdence), become increasingly difﬁcult 
to avoid and be strongly concentrated among the poorest 
vulnerable populations (high conﬁdence). Adaptation does not 
prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and 
before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages will be 
unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are 
not comprehensively addressed by current ﬁnancial, governance and 
institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing 
countries. (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.4, WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.5}

Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate
Section 4
Figure 4.3: Every region faces more severe or frequent compound and/or cascading climate risks in the near term. Changes in risk result from changes in the degree 
of the hazard, the population exposed, and the degree of vulnerability of people, assets, or ecosystems. Panel (a) Coastal ﬂooding events affect many of the highly populated regions 
of the world where large percentages of the population are exposed. The panel shows near-term projected increase of population exposed to 100-year ﬂooding events depicted 
as the increase from the year 2020 to 2040 (due to sea level rise and population change), based on the intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) and current adaptation 
measures. Out-migration from coastal areas due to future sea level rise is not considered in the scenario. Panel (b) projected median probability in the year 2040 for extreme water 
levels resulting from a combination of mean sea level rise, tides and storm surges, which have a historical 1% average annual probability. A peak-over-threshold (99.7%) method 
was applied to the historical tide gauge observations available in the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis version 2 database, which is the same information as WGI Figure 9.32, 
except here the panel uses relative sea level projections under SSP2-4.5 for the year 2040 instead of 2050 The absence of a circle indicates an inability to perform an assessment 
due to a lack of data, but does not indicate absence of increasing frequencies. Panel (c) Climate hazards can initiate risk cascades that affect multiple sectors and propagate across 
regions following complex natural and societal connections. This example of a compound heat wave and a drought event striking an agricultural region shows how multiple risks are 
interconnected and lead to cascading biophysical, economic, and societal impacts even in distant regions, with vulnerable groups such as smallholder farmers, children and pregnant 
women particularly impacted. {WGI Figure 9.32; WGII SPM B4.3, WGII SPM B1.3, WGII SPM B.5.1, WGII TS Figure TS.9, WGII TS Figure TS.10 (c), WGII Fig 5.2, WGII TS.B.2.3, 
WGII TS.B.2.3, WGII TS.B.3.3, WGII 9.11.1.2} 
Actions that prioritise equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes, 
co-beneﬁts, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. 
Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable. 
Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deeper societal ambitions for 
accelerated mitigation. (high conﬁdence)
Adaptation and mitigation actions, across scales, sectors and 
regions, that prioritise equity, climate justice, rights-based 
approaches, social justice and inclusivity, lead to more 
sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative 
change and advance climate resilient development (high 
conﬁdence). Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that 
shield the poor and vulnerable, social safety nets, equity, inclusion 
and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions 
and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals.(SDGs), 
particularly education, hunger, poverty, gender and energy access (high 
conﬁdence). Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development 
context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission reductions 
(medium conﬁdence). Equity, inclusion and just transitions at all 
scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, 
and climate action more broadly (high conﬁdence). The complexity in 
risk of rising food prices, reduced household incomes, and health and 
climate-related malnutrition (particularly maternal malnutrition and 
child undernutrition) and mortality increases with little or low levels 
of adaptation (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.5.1, WGII SPM C.2.9, 
WGII SPM D.2.1, WGII TS Box TS.4; WGIII SPM D.3, WGIII SPM D.3.3, 
WGIII SPM WGIII SPM E.3, SR1.5 SPM D.4.5} (Figure 4.3c)
Regions and people with considerable development constraints 
have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. Adaptation 
outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries 
and regions are enhanced through approaches focusing on 
equity, inclusivity, and rights-based approaches, including 3.3 to 
3.6 billion people living in contexts that are highly vulnerable 
to climate change (high conﬁdence). Vulnerability is higher in 
locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access 
to basic services and resources, violent conﬂict and high levels of 
climate-sensitive livelihoods (e.g., smallholder farmers, pastoralists, 
ﬁshing communities) (high conﬁdence). Several risks can be moderated 
with adaptation (high conﬁdence). The largest adaptation gaps 
exist among lower income population groups (high conﬁdence) and 
adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation 
gaps (high conﬁdence). Present development challenges causing high 
vulnerability are inﬂuenced by historical and ongoing patterns of 
inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples 
and local communities (high conﬁdence). Vulnerability is exacerbated 
by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income 
or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and 
local communities (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.2, WGII SPM B.2.4, 
WGII SPM B.3.2, WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII SPM C.1, WGII SPM C.1.2, 
WGII SPM C.2.9}
Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by 
cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and 
scientiﬁc knowledge can help address adaptation gaps and 
avoid maladaptation (high conﬁdence). Such actions with ﬂexible 
pathways may encourage low-regret and timely actions (very high 
conﬁdence). Integrating climate adaptation into social protection 
programmes, including cash transfers and public works programmes, 
would increase resilience to climate change, especially when supported 
by basic services and infrastructure (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2.3, 
WGII SPM C.4.3, WGII SPM C.4.4, WGII SPM C.2.9, WGII WPM D.3}
Equity, inclusion, just transitions, broad and meaningful 
participation of all relevant actors in decision making at 
all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated 
mitigation, and climate action more broadly, and build social 
trust, support transformative changes and an equitable sharing 
of beneﬁts and burdens (high conﬁdence). Equity remains a 
central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts 
in differentiation between states over time and challenges in 
assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and 
sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with signiﬁcant 
distributional consequences, within and between countries, including 
shifting of income and employment during the transition from high to 
low emissions activities (high conﬁdence). While some jobs may be lost, 
low-emissions development can also open up opportunities to enhance 
skills and create jobs (high conﬁdence). Broadening equitable access 
to ﬁnance, technologies and governance that facilitate mitigation, and 
consideration of climate justice can help equitable sharing of beneﬁts

and burdens, especially for vulnerable countries and communities. 
{WGIII SPM D.3, WGIII SPM D.3.2, WGIII SPM D.3.3, WGIII SPM D.3.4, 
WGIII TS Box TS.4}
Development priorities among countries also reﬂect different 
starting points and contexts, and enabling conditions for 
shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability 
will therefore differ, giving rise to different needs (high 
conﬁdence). Implementing just transition principles through collective 
and participatory decision-making processes is an effective way of 
integrating equity principles into policies at all scales depending 
on national circumstances, while in several countries just transition 
commissions, task forces and national policies have been established 
(medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM D.3.1, WGIII SPM D.3.3}
Many economic and regulatory instruments have been 
effective in reducing emissions and practical experience has 
informed instrument design to improve them while addressing 
distributional goals and social acceptance (high conﬁdence). The 
design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices are 
presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making 
the combination more effective (medium conﬁdence). Individuals with 
high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, 
and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as 
citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals (high 
conﬁdence). There are options on design of instruments such as taxes, 
subsidies, prices, and consumption-based approaches, complemented 
by regulatory instruments to reduce high-emissions consumption while 
improving equity and societal well-being (high conﬁdence). Behaviour 
and lifestyle changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive 
options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and technology 
with multiple co-beneﬁts for societal well-being (high conﬁdence). 
Broadening equitable access to domestic and international ﬁnance, 
technologies and capacity can also act as a catalyst for accelerating 
mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts 
(high conﬁdence). Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and 
providing decent living standards to all in these regions in the context of 
achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can be 
achieved without signiﬁcant global emissions growth (high conﬁdence). 
Technology development, transfer, capacity building and ﬁnancing can 
support developing countries/ regions leapfrogging or transitioning to 
low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-beneﬁts 
(high conﬁdence). Climate resilient development is advanced when 
actors work in equitable, just and enabling ways to reconcile divergent 
interests, values and worldviews, toward equitable and just outcomes 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII D.2.1, WGIII SPM B.3.3, WGIII SPM.C.8.5, WGIII 
SPM C.10.2, WGIII SPM C.10.4, WGIII SPM D.3.4, WGIII SPM E.4.2, 
WGIII TS.5.1, WGIII 5.4, WGIII 5.8, WGIII 15.2}
Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems 
are necessary to achieve deep emissions reductions and secure 
a liveable and sustainable future for all (high conﬁdence). System 
transitions151 consistent with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C 
(>50%) with no or limited overshoot are more rapid and pronounced 
in the near-term than in those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) 
(high conﬁdence). Such a systemic change is unprecedented in terms 
of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed (medium conﬁdence). 
The system transitions make possible the transformative adaptation 
required for high levels of human health and well-being, economic and 
social resilience, ecosystem health, and planetary health. {WGII SPM

151 System transitions involve a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options that enable deep emissions reductions and transformative adaptation in all sectors. This report 
has a particular focus on the following system transitions: energy; industry; cities, settlements and infrastructure; land, ocean, food and water; health and nutrition; and society, 
livelihood and economies. {WGII SPM A, WGII Figure SPM.1, WGII Figure SPM.4; SR1.5 SPM C.2}

global GHG emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030 (options 
costing less than USD 20 tCO2-eq–1 are estimated to make up more 
than half of this potential) (high conﬁdence) (Figure 4.4). The 
availability, feasibility152 and potential of mitigation or effectiveness 
of adaptation options in the near term differ across systems and 
regions (very high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2; WGIII SPM C.12, 
WGIII SPM E.1.1; SR1.5 SPM B.6} 
Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service 
provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 
40 to 70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some 
regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy 
and resources. Demand-side mitigation encompasses changes in 
infrastructure use, end-use technology adoption, and socio-cultural and 
behavioural change. (high conﬁdence) (Figure 4.4). {WGIII SPM C.10}
4.5 Near-Term Mitigation and Adaptation Actions
Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep and sustained 
emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. These system transitions involve a 
signiﬁcant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. Feasible, effective and low-cost 
options for mitigation and adaptation are already available, with differences across systems and regions. (high

Figure 4.4: Multiple Opportunities for scaling up climate action. Panel (a) presents selected mitigation and adaptation options across different systems. The left hand side 
of panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As 
literature above 1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. The term response is used here in addition to 
adaptation because some responses, such as migration, relocation and resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, 
allows reduction of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation 
and afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) were used 
to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the 
ﬁgure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identiﬁed as high, medium, and low. The right-hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected 
mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the longer term compared to 2030. Costs 
are net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net 
GHG emission reduction that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a speciﬁed emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions are the sum of reduced emissions 
and/or enhanced sinks. The baseline used consists of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25–75 percentile values). The mitigation 
potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not necessarily additive. Health system mitigation options are included mostly in settlement and infrastructure 
(e.g., efﬁcient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identiﬁed separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. The length 
of the solid bars represents the mitigation potential of an option. Potentials are broken down into cost categories, indicated by different colours (see legend). Only discounted lifetime 
monetary costs are considered. Where a gradual colour transition is shown, the breakdown of the potential into cost categories is not well known or depends heavily on factors such 
as geographical location, resource availability, and regional circumstances, and the colours indicate the range of estimates. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. 
When interpreting this ﬁgure, the following should be taken into account: (1) The mitigation potential is uncertain, as it will depend on the reference technology (and emissions) 
being displaced, the rate of new technology adoption, and several other factors; (2) Different options have different feasibilities beyond the cost aspects, which are not reﬂected in 
the ﬁgure; and (3) Costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until 2030, and are not included. 
Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all 
global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced 
by national governments until 2020. The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying 
the highest and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use patterns 
enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, 
food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-
side mitigation options in other sectors can inﬂuence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due 
to increasing electriﬁcation in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, this projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation 
options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural factors that inﬂuence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow). {WGII Figure SPM.4, 
WGII Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18; WGIII SPM C.10, WGIII 12.2.1, WGIII 12.2.2, WGIII Figure SPM.6, WGIII Figure SPM.7}
4.5.1. Energy Systems
Rapid and deep reductions in GHG emissions require major 
energy system transitions (high conﬁdence). Adaptation options 
can help reduce climate-related risks to the energy system 
(very high conﬁdence). Net zero CO2 energy systems entail: a 
substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of 
unabated fossil fuels153, and use of Carbon Capture and Storage in 
the remaining fossil fuel systems; electricity systems that emit no 
net CO2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in 
applications less amenable to electrification; energy conservation 
and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy system 
(high confidence). Large contributions to emissions reductions can 
come from options costing less than USD 20 tCO2-eq–1, including 
solar and wind energy, energy efﬁciency improvements, and CH4 
(methane) emissions reductions (from coal mining, oil and gas, and 
waste) (medium confidence).154 Many of these response options are 
technically viable and are supported by the public (high confidence). 
Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and 
sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission 
systems (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.10; WGIII SPM C.4.1, 
WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII SPM C.12.1, WGIII SPM E.1.1, WGIII TS.5.1} 
Climate change and related extreme events will affect future energy 
systems, including hydropower production, bioenergy yields, thermal 
power plant efﬁciencies, and demands for heating and cooling (high 
153 In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted throughout the life 
cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO2 from power plants, or 50–80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply. {WGIII SPM footnote 54}
154 The mitigation potentials and mitigation costs of individual technologies in a speciﬁc context or region may differ greatly from the provided estimates (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGIII SPM C.12.1}
conﬁdence). The most feasible energy system adaptation options 
support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efﬁcient 
water use for existing and new energy generation systems (very 
high conﬁdence). Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric 
power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, 
with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming (medium 
conﬁdence). Energy generation diversiﬁcation (e.g., wind, solar, small-
scale hydroelectric) and demand side management (e.g., storage and 
energy efﬁciency improvements) can increase energy reliability and 
reduce vulnerabilities to climate change, especially in rural populations 
(high conﬁdence). Climate responsive energy markets, updated design 
standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate 
change, smart-grid technologies, robust transmission systems and 
improved capacity to respond to supply deﬁcits have high feasibility 
in the medium- to long-term, with mitigation co-beneﬁts (very high 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.5.3, WGII SPM C.2.10; WGIII TS.5.1}
4.5.2. Industry
There are several options to reduce industrial emissions 
that differ by type of industry; many industries are disrupted 
by climate change, especially from extreme events (high 
conﬁdence). Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated 
action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, 
including demand management, energy and materials efﬁciency, 
circular material ﬂows, as well as abatement technologies and 
105
Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate
Section 4
transformational changes in production processes (high conﬁdence). 
Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through 
available abatement technologies (e.g., material efﬁciency, circularity), 
electriﬁcation (e.g., electrothermal heating, heat pumps), and switching 
to low- and zero-GHG emitting fuels (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia, and 
bio-based and other synthetic fuels) (high conﬁdence), while deep 
reduction of cement process emissions will rely on cementitious 
material substitution and the availability of Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CCS) until new chemistries are mastered (high conﬁdence). Reducing 
emissions from the production and use of chemicals would need to rely 
on a life cycle approach, including increased plastics recycling, fuel and 
feedstock switching, and carbon sourced through biogenic sources, and, 
depending on availability, Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), direct 
air CO2 capture, as well as CCS (high conﬁdence). Action to reduce 
industry sector emissions may change the location of GHG-intensive 
industries and the organisation of value chains, with distributional 
effects on employment and economic structure (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGII TS.B.9.1, WGII 16.5.2; WGIII SPM C.5, WGIII SPM C.5.2, 
WGIII SPM C.5.3, WGIII TS.5.5}
Many industrial and service sectors are negatively affected by climate 
change through supply and operational disruptions, especially from 
extreme events (high conﬁdence), and will require adaptation efforts. 
Water intensive industries (e.g., mining) can undertake measures to 
reduce water stress, such as water recycling and reuse, using brackish 
or saline sources, working to improve water use efﬁciency. However, 
residual risks will remain, especially at higher levels of warming 
(medium conﬁdence). {WGII TS.B.9.1, WGII 16.5.2, WGII 4.6.3} (Section 3.2)
4.5.3. Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure
Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions 
reductions and advancing climate resilient development, 
particularly when this involves integrated planning that 
incorporates physical, natural and social infrastructure (high 
conﬁdence). Deep emissions reductions and integrated adaptation 
actions are advanced by: integrated, inclusive land use planning 
and decision-making; compact urban form by co-locating jobs and 
housing; reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption; 
electriﬁcation in combination with low emissions sources; improved 
water and waste management infrastructure; and enhancing carbon 
uptake and storage in the urban environment (e.g. bio-based building 
materials, permeable surfaces and urban green and blue infrastructure). 
Cities can achieve net zero emissions if emissions are reduced within 
and outside of their administrative boundaries through supply chains, 
creating beneﬁcial cascading effects across other sectors. (high conﬁdence) 
{WGII SPM C.5.6, WGII SPM D.1.3, WGII SPM D.3; WGIII SPM C.6, WGIII 
SPM C.6.2, WGIII TS 5.4, SR1.5 SPM C.2.4}
Considering climate change impacts and risks (e.g., through climate 
services) in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements 
and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human 
well-being. Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, 
construction, retroﬁt, use and disposal stages for buildings. Mitigation 
interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, low-
155 A set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries. 
{WGIII Annex I}
emission construction materials, highly efﬁcient building envelope 
and the integration of renewable energy solutions; at the use phase, 
highly efﬁcient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use 
of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; 
and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction 
materials. Sufﬁciency155 measures can limit the demand for energy 
and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances. (high 
conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2.5; WGIII SPM C.7.2}
Transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced by demand-side 
options and low-GHG emissions technologies. Changes in urban form, 
reallocation of street space for cycling and walking, digitalisation 
(e.g., teleworking) and programs that encourage changes in consumer 
behaviour (e.g. transport, pricing) can reduce demand for transport 
services and support the shift to more energy efﬁcient transport 
modes (high conﬁdence). Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions 
electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based 
transport, on a life cycle basis (high conﬁdence). Costs of electriﬁed 
vehicles are decreasing and their adoption is accelerating, but they 
require continued investments in supporting infrastructure to increase 
scale of deployment (high conﬁdence). The environmental footprint of 
battery production and growing concerns about critical minerals can 
be addressed by material and supply diversiﬁcation strategies, energy 
and material efﬁciency improvements, and circular material ﬂows 
(medium conﬁdence). Advances in battery technologies could facilitate 
the electriﬁcation of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional 
electric rail systems (medium conﬁdence). Sustainable biofuels can offer 
additional mitigation beneﬁts in land-based transport in the short and 
medium term (medium conﬁdence). Sustainable biofuels, low-emissions 
hydrogen, and derivatives (including synthetic fuels) can support 
mitigation of CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty 
land transport but require production process improvements and cost 
reductions (medium conﬁdence). Key infrastructure systems including 
sanitation, water, health, transport, communications and energy will 
be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for 
changing climate conditions (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM B.2.5; 
WGIII SPM C.6.2, WGIII SPM C.8, WGIII SPM C.8.1, WGIII SPM C.8.2, 
WGIII SPM C.10.2, WGIII SPM C.10.3, WGIII SPM C.10.4} 
Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green 
roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration can mitigate climate change 
through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced 
energy use while reducing risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, 
heavy precipitation and droughts, and advancing co-beneﬁts for health, 
well-being and livelihoods (medium conﬁdence). Urban greening can 
provide local cooling (very high conﬁdence). Combining green/natural 
and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential 
to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to ﬂood control, sanitation, 
water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal 
protection (medium conﬁdence). Globally, more ﬁnancing is directed 
at grey/physical infrastructure than green/natural infrastructure 
and social infrastructure (medium conﬁdence), and there is limited 
evidence of investment in informal settlements (medium to high 
conﬁdence). The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be 
achieved by prioritising ﬁnance to reduce climate risk for low-income 
106

and marginalised communities including people living in informal 
settlements (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2.5, WGII SPM C.2.6, WGII 
SPM C.2.7, WGII SPM D.3.2, WGII TS.E.1.4, WGII Cross-Chapter Box FEAS; 
WGIII SPM C.6, WGIII SPM C.6.2, WGIII SPM D.1.3, WGIII SPM D.2.1}
Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying 
coastal cities and settlements and small islands include protection, 
accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses 
are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, 
aligned with sociocultural values and development priorities, and 
underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes. (high 
conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2.8}
4.5.4. Land, Ocean, Food, and Water
There is substantial mitigation and adaptation potential from 
options in agriculture, forestry and other land use, and in the 
oceans, that could be upscaled in the near term across most 
regions (high conﬁdence) (Figure 4.5). Conservation, improved 
management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer 
the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced 
deforestation in tropical regions having the highest total mitigation 
potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can 
lead to trade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing 
trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple objectives 
including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable 
healthy diets and reducing food loss/waste) and sustainable agricultural 
intensiﬁcation can reduce ecosystem conversion and CH4 and N2O emissions, 
and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. 
Sustainably sourced agriculture and forest products, including 
long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive 
products in other sectors. Effective adaptation options include cultivar 
improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and 
landscape diversiﬁcation, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response 
options require integration of biophysical, socioeconomic and other 
enabling factors. The effectiveness of ecosystem-based adaptation 
and most water-related adaptation options declines with increasing 
warming (see 3.2). (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2, 
WGII SPM C.2.5; WGIII SPM C.9.1; SRCCL SPM B.1.1, SRCCL SPM B.5.4, 
SRCCL SPM D.1; SROCC SPM C} 
Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems 
(e.g., peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests), have 
immediate impacts while others, such as restoration of high-carbon 
ecosystems, reclamation of degraded soils or afforestation, take decades 
to deliver measurable results (high conﬁdence). Many sustainable land 
management technologies and practices are ﬁnancially proﬁtable in three 
to ten years (medium conﬁdence). {SRCCL SPM B.1.2, SRCCL SPM D.2.2} 
Maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem 
services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable 
conservation of approximately 30–50% of Earth’s land, 
freshwater and ocean areas, including currently near-natural 
ecosystems (high conﬁdence). The services and options provided by 
terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems can be supported 
156 Balanced diets refer to diets that feature plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food 
produced in resilient, sustainable and low-GHG emission systems, as described in SRCCL.
by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management 
of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other 
stressors (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.4, WGII SPM D.4; 
SROCC SPM C.2} 
Large-scale land conversion for bioenergy, biochar, or afforestation 
can increase risks to biodiversity, water and food security. In contrast, 
restoring natural forests and drained peatlands, and improving 
sustainability of managed forests enhances the resilience of carbon 
stocks and sinks and reduces ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. 
Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with local communities 
and Indigenous Peoples, as well as recognition of inherent rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, is integral to successful adaptation across 
forests and other ecosystems. (high confidence) {WGII SPM B.5.4, 
WGII SPM C.2.3, WGII SPM C.2.4; WGIII SPM D.2.3; SRCCL B.7.3, 
SRCCL SPM C.4.3, SRCCL TS.7} 
Natural rivers, wetlands and upstream forests reduce ﬂood risk in most 
circumstances (high conﬁdence). Enhancing natural water retention 
such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, land use planning such as no 
build zones or upstream forest management, can further reduce ﬂood risk 
(medium conﬁdence). For inland ﬂooding, combinations of non-structural 
measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees 
have reduced loss of lives (medium confidence), but hard defences 
against flooding or sea level rise can also be maladaptive 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.4.1, WGII SPM C.4.2, 
WGII SPM C.2.5}
Protection and restoration of coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems 
(e.g., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows) could 
reduce emissions and/or increase carbon uptake and storage (medium 
conﬁdence). Coastal wetlands protect against coastal erosion 
and ﬂooding (very high conﬁdence). Strengthening precautionary 
approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted ﬁsheries, and 
responsiveness of existing ﬁsheries management strategies reduces 
negative climate change impacts on ﬁsheries, with beneﬁts for regional 
economies and livelihoods (medium conﬁdence). Ecosystem-based 
management in fisheries and aquaculture supports food security, 
biodiversity, human health and well-being (high confidence). 
{WGII SPM C.2.2, WGII SPM C.2; SROCC SPM C2.3, SROCC SPM C.2.4} 
4.5.5. Health and Nutrition
Human health will beneﬁt from integrated mitigation and 
adaptation options that mainstream health into food, 
infrastructure, social protection, and water policies (very high 
conﬁdence). Balanced and sustainable healthy diets156 and reduced 
food loss and waste present important opportunities for adaptation 
and mitigation while generating signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts in terms 
of biodiversity and human health (high conﬁdence). Public health 
policies to improve nutrition, such as increasing the diversity of food 
sources in public procurement, health insurance, ﬁnancial incentives, 
and awareness-raising campaigns, can potentially influence food 
demand, reduce food waste, reduce healthcare costs, contribute to 
lower GHG emissions and enhance adaptive capacity (high conﬁdence).

Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate

Improved access to clean energy sources and technologies, and shifts 
to active mobility (e.g., walking and cycling) and public transport can 
deliver socioeconomic, air quality and health benefits, especially 
for women and children (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.2, WGII

SRCCL SPM B.6.3, SRCCL B.4.6, SRCCL SPM C.2.4}
Effective adaptation options exist to help protect human health 
and well-being (high conﬁdence). Health Action Plans that include 
early warning and response systems are effective for extreme heat (high 
conﬁdence). Effective options for water-borne and food-borne diseases 
include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and 
sanitation systems to ﬂooding and extreme weather events, and improved 
early warning systems (very high conﬁdence). For vector-borne diseases, 
effective adaptation options include surveillance, early warning 
systems, and vaccine development (very high conﬁdence). Effective 
adaptation options for reducing mental health risks under climate 
change include improving surveillance and access to mental health 
care, and monitoring of psychosocial impacts from extreme weather 
events (high conﬁdence). A key pathway to climate resilience in the 
health sector is universal access to healthcare (high conﬁdence).

4.5.6 Society, Livelihoods, and Economies
Enhancing knowledge on risks and available adaptation options 
promotes societal responses, and behaviour and lifestyle changes 
supported by policies, infrastructure and technology can help 
reduce global GHG emissions (high conﬁdence). Climate literacy 
and information provided through climate services and community 
approaches, including those that are informed by Indigenous Knowledge 
and local knowledge, can accelerate behavioural changes and planning 
(high conﬁdence). Educational and information programmes, using 
the arts, participatory modelling and citizen science can facilitate 
awareness, heighten risk perception, and inﬂuence behaviours (high 
conﬁdence). The way choices are presented can enable adoption of low 
GHG intensive socio-cultural options, such as shifts to balanced, sustainable 
healthy diets, reduced food waste, and active mobility (high conﬁdence). 
Judicious labelling, framing, and communication of social norms can 
increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM C.5.3, WGII TS.D.10.1; WGIII SPM C.10, WGIII SPM C.10.2, 
WGIII SPM C.10.3, WGIII SPM E.2.2, WGIII Figure SPM.6, WGIII TS.6.1, 
5.4; SR1.5 SPM D.5.6; SROCC SPM C.4}
A range of adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, 
early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and 
sharing approaches, have broad applicability across sectors 
and provide greater risk reduction beneﬁts when combined 
(high conﬁdence). Climate services that are demand-driven and 
inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural 
practices, inform better water use and efﬁciency, and enable resilient 
infrastructure planning (high conﬁdence). Policy mixes that include 
weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety 
nets, contingent ﬁnance and reserve funds, and universal access to 
early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can 
reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems (high conﬁdence). 
Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, 
including cash transfers and public works programs, is highly feasible 
and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported 
by basic services and infrastructure (high conﬁdence). Social safety nets 
can build adaptive capacities, reduce socioeconomic vulnerability, and 
reduce risk linked to hazards (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
{WGII SPM C.2.9, WGII SPM C.2.13, WGII Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in 
Chapter 18; SRCCL SPM C.1.4, SRCCL SPM D.1.2}
Reducing future risks of involuntary migration and displacement 
due to climate change is possible through cooperative, international 
efforts to enhance institutional adaptive capacity and sustainable 
development (high conﬁdence). Increasing adaptive capacity minimises 
risk associated with involuntary migration and immobility and improves 
the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, while 
policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for 
safe, orderly and regular migration that allows vulnerable people to adapt 
to climate change (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.2.12, WGII TS.D.8.6, 
WGII Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7}
Accelerating commitment and follow-through by the private 
sector is promoted for instance by building business cases for 
adaptation, accountability and transparency mechanisms, and 
monitoring and evaluation of adaptation progress (medium 
conﬁdence). Integrated pathways for managing climate risks will 
be most suitable when so-called ‘low-regret’ anticipatory options are 
established jointly across sectors in a timely manner and are feasible 
and effective in their local context, and when path dependencies and 
maladaptations across sectors are avoided (high conﬁdence). Sustained 
adaptation actions are strengthened by mainstreaming adaptation into 
institutional budget and policy planning cycles, statutory planning, 
monitoring and evaluation frameworks and into recovery efforts 
from disaster events (high conﬁdence). Instruments that incorporate 
adaptation such as policy and legal frameworks, behavioural incentives, 
and economic instruments that address market failures, such as 
climate risk disclosure, inclusive and deliberative processes strengthen 
adaptation actions by public and private actors (medium conﬁdence).

Many mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple synergies 
with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but some actions 
can also have trade-offs. Potential synergies with SDGs exceed 
potential trade-offs. Synergies and trade-offs are context specific 
and depend on: means and scale of implementation, intra- and 
inter-sectoral interactions, cooperation between countries and regions, 
the sequencing, timing and stringency of actions, governance, and 
policy design. Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and 
providing decent living standards to all, consistent with near-
term sustainable development objectives, can be achieved 
without significant global emissions growth. (high confidence) 
{WGII SPM C.2.3, WGII Figure SPM.4b; WGIII SPM B.3.3, WGIII SPM C.9.2, 
WGIII SPM D.1.2, WGIII SPM D.1.4, WGIII Figure SPM.8} (Figure 4.5)
Several mitigation and adaptation options can harness near-
term synergies and reduce trade-offs to advance sustainable 
development in energy, urban and land systems (Figure 4.5) 
(high conﬁdence). Clean energy supply systems have multiple 
co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. 
Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response 
systems, approaches that mainstream health into food, livelihoods, 
social protection, water and sanitation benefit health and well-
being. There are potential synergies between multiple Sustainable 
Development Goals and sustainable land use and urban planning 
with more green spaces, reduced air pollution, and demand-side 
mitigation including shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets. 
Electriﬁcation combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts to public 
transport can enhance health, employment, and can contribute to 
energy security and deliver equity. Conservation, protection and 
restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems, 
together with targeted management to adapt to unavoidable impacts 
of climate change can generate multiple additional beneﬁts, such as 
agricultural productivity, food security, and biodiversity conservation. 
(high confidence) {WGII SPM C.1.1, WGII C.2.4, WGII SPM D.1, 
WGII Figure SPM.4, WGII Cross-Chapter Box HEALTH in Chapter 17, 
WGII Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18; WGIII SPM C.4.2, 
WGIII SPM D.1.3, WGIII SPM D.2, WGIII Figure SPM.8; SRCCL SPM B.4.6}
When implementing mitigation and adaptation together, and 
taking trade-offs into account, multiple co-beneﬁts and synergies 
for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health 
can be realised (high conﬁdence). There is a strong link between 
sustainable development, vulnerability and climate risks. Social safety 
nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-beneﬁts 
with development goals such as education, poverty alleviation, gender 
inclusion and food security. Land restoration contributes to mitigation 
and adaptation with synergies via enhanced ecosystem services and 
with economically positive returns and co-beneﬁts for poverty reduction 
and improved livelihoods. Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised 
by giving emphasis to capacity building, ﬁnance, technology transfer, 
investments; governance, development, context speciﬁc gender-based 
and other social equity considerations with meaningful participation 
of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and vulnerable populations.

Context 
relevant 
design 
and 
implementation 
requires 
considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other sustainable 
development dimensions (very high conﬁdence). Countries at 
all stages of economic development seek to improve the well-being 
of people, and their development priorities reﬂect different starting 
points and contexts. Different contexts include but are not limited to 
social, economic, environmental, cultural, or political circumstances, 
resource endowment, capabilities, international environment, and prior 
development. n regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, among 
other things, revenue and employment generation, mitigating risks for 
sustainable development requires policies that promote economic and 
energy sector diversiﬁcation and considerations of just transitions 
principles, processes and practices (high conﬁdence). For individuals and 
households in low-lying coastal areas, in Small Islands, and smallholder 
farmers transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation 
can help overcome soft adaptation limits (high conﬁdence). Effective 
governance is needed to limit trade-offs of some mitigation options 
such as large scale afforestation and bioenergy options due to risks 
from their deployment for food systems, biodiversity, other ecosystem 
functions and services, and livelihoods (high conﬁdence). Effective 
governance requires adequate institutional capacity at all levels 
(high confidence). {WGII SPM B.5.4, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM

4.6 Co-Beneﬁts of Adaptation and Mitigation for Sustainable Development Goals
Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). Synergies and trade-offs depend on context and scale of implementation. Potential trade-offs can be 
compensated or avoided with additional policies, investments and ﬁnancial partnerships. (high conﬁdence)

Figure 4.5: Potential synergies and trade-offs between the portfolio of climate change mitigation and adaptation options and the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). This ﬁgure presents a high-level summary of potential synergies and trade-offs assessed in WGII Figure SPM.4b and WGIII Figure SPM.8, based on the qualitative and 
quantitative assessment of each individual mitigation or option. The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of different sustainable development dimensions, which 
extend beyond the time frame of 2030 SDG targets. Synergies and trade-offs across all individual options within a sector/system are aggregated into sector/system potentials for the 
whole mitigation or adaptation portfolio. The length of each bar represents the total number of mitigation or adaptation options under each system/sector. The number of adaptation 
and mitigation options vary across system/sector, and have been normalised to 100% so that bars are comparable across mitigation, adaptation, system/sector, and SDGs. Positive 
links shown in WGII Figure SPM.4b and WGIII Figure SPM.8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of synergies, represented here by the blue proportion 
within the bars. Negative links shown in WGII Figure SPM.4b and WGIII Figure SPM.8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of trade-offs and is represented 
by orange proportion within the bars. ‘Both synergies and trade-offs’ shown in WGII Figure SPM.4b WGIII Figure SPM.8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share 
of ‘both synergies and trade-off’, represented by the striped proportion within the bars. The ‘white’ proportion within the bar indicates limited evidence/ no evidence/ not assessed. 
Energy systems comprise all mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 and WGII Figure SPM.4b for adaptation. Urban and infrastructure comprises all mitigation options listed

in WGIII Figure SPM.8 under Urban systems, under Buildings and under Transport and adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Urban and infrastructure systems. Land 
system comprises mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 under AFOLU and adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Land and ocean systems: forest-based 
adaptation, agroforestry, biodiversity management and ecosystem connectivity, improved cropland management, efﬁcient livestock management, water use efﬁciency and water 
resource management. Ocean ecosystems comprises adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Land and ocean systems: coastal defence and hardening, integrated 
coastal zone management and sustainable aquaculture and ﬁsheries. Society, livelihood and economies comprises adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Cross-
sectoral; Industry comprises all those mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 under Industry. SDG 13 (Climate Action) is not listed because mitigation/ adaptation is being 
considered in terms of interaction with SDGs and not vice versa (SPM SR1.5 Figure SPM.4 caption). The bars denote the strength of the connection and do not consider the strength 
of the impact on the SDGs. The synergies and trade-offs differ depending on the context and the scale of implementation. Scale of implementation particularly matters when there is 
competition for scarce resources. For the sake of uniformity, we are not reporting the conﬁdence levels because there is knowledge gap in adaptation option wise relation with SDGs 
and their conﬁdence level which is evident from WGII ﬁg SPM.4b. {WGII Figure SPM.4b; WGIII Figure SPM.8}
Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation 
by providing overall direction based on national circumstances, 
setting targets and priorities, mainstreaming climate action across 
policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and 
in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance 
enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory certainty, 
prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, 
and improves access to ﬁnance and technology (high conﬁdence). 
These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws and 
plans, which are growing in number across sectors and regions, 
advancing mitigation outcomes and adaptation benefits (high 
confidence). Climate laws have been growing in number and 
have helped deliver mitigation and adaptation outcomes (medium 
conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.5, WGII SPM C.5.1, WGII SPM C5.4, WGII SPM C.5.6; 
WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM E.3.1}
Effective 
municipal, 
national 
and 
sub-national 
climate 
institutions, such as expert and co-ordinating bodies, enable 
co-produced, multi-scale decision-processes, build consensus 
for action among diverse interests, and inform strategy settings 
(high conﬁdence). This requires adequate institutional capacity at 
all levels (high conﬁdence). Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often 
reduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, 
participatory processes, and interventions that address context 
speciﬁc inequities such as based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, 
location and income (high conﬁdence). Policy support is inﬂuenced by 
Indigenous Peoples, businesses, and actors in civil society, including, 
youth, labour, media, and local communities, and effectiveness is 
enhanced by partnerships between many different groups in society 
(high conﬁdence). Climate-related litigation is growing, with a large 
number of cases in some developed countries and with a much smaller 
number in some developing countries, and in some cases has inﬂuenced 
the outcome and ambition of climate governance (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM C2.6, WGII SPM C.5.2, WGII SPM C.5.5, WGII SPM C.5.6, 
WGII SPM D.3.1; WGIII SPM E3.2, WGIII SPM E.3.3}
Effective climate governance is enabled by inclusive decision 
processes, allocation of appropriate resources, and institutional 
review, monitoring and evaluation (high conﬁdence). Multi-level, 
hybrid and cross-sector governance facilitates appropriate consideration 
for co-beneﬁts and trade-offs, particularly in land sectors where decision 
processes range from farm level to national scale (high conﬁdence). 
Consideration of climate justice can help to facilitate shifting development 
pathways towards sustainability. {WGII SPM C.5.5, WGII SPM C.5.6, 
WGII SPM D.1.1, WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.3.2; SRCCL SPM C.3, 
SRCCL TS.1}
Drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships, including 
with women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and 
ethnic minorities can facilitate climate resilient development 
and has allowed locally appropriate and socially acceptable 
solutions (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM D.2, D.2.1}
Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been 
deployed successfully. These instruments could support deep 
emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely. 
Practical experience has informed instrument design and helped to 
improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efﬁciency, 
and equity. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM E.4; WGIII SPM E.4.2}
Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments, 
consistent with national circumstances, can improve mitigation 
outcomes in sectoral applications (high conﬁdence), and 
regulatory instruments that include ﬂexibility mechanisms 
can reduce costs of cutting emissions (medium conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM E.4.1} 
Where implemented, carbon pricing instruments have incentivized 
low-cost emissions reduction measures, but have been less 
effective, on their own and at prevailing prices during the 
assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary 
for further reductions (medium conﬁdence). Revenue from carbon 
taxes or emissions trading can be used for equity and distributional 
goals, for example to support low-income households, among other 
4.7 Governance and Policy for Near-Term Climate Change Action
Effective climate action requires political commitment, well-aligned multi-level governance and institutional 
frameworks, laws, policies and strategies. It needs clear goals, adequate ﬁnance and ﬁnancing tools, coordination 
across multiple policy domains, and inclusive governance processes. Many mitigation and adaptation policy 
instruments have been deployed successfully, and could support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience 
if scaled up and applied widely, depending on national circumstances. Adaptation and mitigation action beneﬁts 
from drawing on diverse knowledge. (high conﬁdence)

Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate
Section 4
4.8.1. Finance for Mitigation and Adaptation Actions
Improved availability and access to ﬁnance157 will enable 
accelerated climate action (very high conﬁdence). Addressing 
needs and gaps and broadening equitable access to domestic and 
international ﬁnance, when combined with other supportive actions, can 
act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development 
pathways (high conﬁdence). Climate resilient development is enabled 
by increased international cooperation including improved access 
to ﬁnancial resources, particularly for vulnerable regions, sectors 
and groups, and inclusive governance and coordinated policies (high 
conﬁdence). Accelerated international ﬁnancial cooperation is a critical 
enabler of low-GHG and just transitions, and can address inequities in 
access to ﬁnance and the costs of, and vulnerability to, the impacts of 
climate change (high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.2, 
WGII SPM C.5, WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.3.2, 
WGII SPM D.5, WGII SPM D.5.2; WGIII SPM B.4.2,WGIII SPM B.5, 
WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII SPM C.7.3, WGIII SPM C.8.5, 
WGIII SPM D.1.2, WGIII SPM D.2.4, WGIII SPM D.3.4, WGIII SPM E.2.3, 
WGIII SPM E.3.1, WGIII SPM E.5, WGIII SPM E.5.1, WGIII SPM E.5.2, 
WGIII SPM E.5.3, WGIII SPM E.5.4, WGIII SPM E.6.2}
Both adaptation and mitigation ﬁnance need to increase many-fold, 
to address rising climate risks and to accelerate investments in 
emissions reduction (high conﬁdence). Increased ﬁnance would 
address soft limits to adaptation and rising climate risks while also averting 
157 Finance can originate from diverse sources, singly or in combination: public or private, local, national or international, bilateral or multilateral, and alternative sources 
(e.g., philanthropic, carbon offsets). It can be in the form of grants, technical assistance, loans (concessional and non-concessional), bonds, equity, risk insurance and ﬁnancial 
guarantees (of various types).
some related losses and damages, particularly in vulnerable developing 
countries (high conﬁdence). Enhanced mobilisation of and access to 
ﬁnance, together with building capacity, are essential for implementation 
of adaptation actions and to reduce adaptation gaps given rising risks 
and costs, especially for the most vulnerable groups, regions and sectors 
(high conﬁdence). Public ﬁnance is an important enabler of adaptation 
and mitigation, and can also leverage private ﬁnance (high conﬁdence). 
Adaptation funding predominately comes from public sources, and 
public mechanisms and ﬁnance can leverage private sector ﬁnance by 
addressing real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, for 
instance via public-private partnerships (high conﬁdence). Financial and 
technological resources enable effective and ongoing implementation 
of adaptation, especially when supported by institutions with a strong 
understanding of adaptation needs and capacity (high conﬁdence). 
Average annual modelled mitigation investment requirements for 
2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a 
factor of three to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation 
investments (public, private, domestic and international) would need 
to increase across all sectors and regions (medium conﬁdence). Even 
if extensive global mitigation efforts are implemented, there will be a 
large need for ﬁnancial, technical, and human resources for adaptation 
(high conﬁdence). {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C2.11, WGII SPM C.3, 
WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C3.5, WGII SPM C.5, WGII SPM C.5.4, 
WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM D.1.1, WGII SPM D.1.2, WGII SPM C.5.4; 
WGIII SPM D.2.4, WGIII SPM E.5, WGIII SPM E.5.1, WGIII 15.2} 
(Section 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 4.4, Figure 4.6)
approaches (high conﬁdence). There is no consistent evidence that 
current emission trading systems have led to signiﬁcant emissions 
leakage (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM E4.2, WGIII SPM E.4.6} 
Removing fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions, improve 
public revenue and macroeconomic performance, and yield 
other environmental and sustainable development beneﬁts such 
as improved public revenue, macroeconomic and sustainability 
performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional 
impacts especially on the most economically vulnerable 
groups which, in some cases, can be mitigated by measures 
such as re-distributing revenue saved, and depend on national 
circumstances (high conﬁdence). Fossil fuel subsidy removal is 
projected by various studies to reduce global CO2 emissions by 1–4%, 
and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying across regions 
(medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM E.4.2} 
National policies to support technology development, and 
participation in international markets for emission reduction, 
can bring positive spillover effects for other countries 
(medium conﬁdence), although reduced demand for fossil fuels as 
a result of climate policy could result in costs to exporting countries 
(high confidence). Economy-wide packages can meet short-term 
economic goals while reducing emissions and shifting development 
pathways towards sustainability (medium confidence). Examples 
are public spending commitments; pricing reforms; and investment 
in education and training, R&D and infrastructure (high confidence). 
Effective policy packages would be comprehensive in coverage, 
harnessed to a clear vision for change, balanced across objectives, 
aligned with specific technology and system needs, consistent 
in terms of design and tailored to national circumstances (high 
confidence). {WGIII SPM E4.4, WGIII SPM 4.5, WGIII SPM 4.6}
4.8 Strengthening the Response: Finance, International Cooperation and Technology
Finance, international cooperation and technology are critical enablers for accelerated climate action. If climate 
goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation ﬁnancing would have to increase many-fold. There is 
sufﬁcient global capital to close the global investment gaps but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate 
action. Barriers include institutional, regulatory and market access barriers, which can be reduced to address the 
needs and opportunities, economic vulnerability and indebtedness in many developing countries. Enhancing 
international cooperation is possible through multiple channels. Enhancing technology innovation systems is 
key to accelerate the widespread adoption of technologies and practices. (high conﬁdence) 
112
Section 4
Section 1
Section 4
There is sufﬁcient global capital and liquidity to close global 
investment gaps, given the size of the global ﬁnancial system, 
but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action 
both within and outside the global ﬁnancial sector and in the 
context of economic vulnerabilities and indebtedness facing 
many developing countries (high conﬁdence). For shifts in private 
finance, options include better assessment of climate-related risks 
and investment opportunities within the financial system, reducing 
sectoral and regional mismatches between available capital and 
investment needs, improving the risk-return profiles of climate 
investments, and developing institutional capacities and local 
capital markets. Macroeconomic barriers include, amongst others, 
indebtedness and economic vulnerability of developing regions. 
(high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM E.4.2, WGIII SPM E.5, 
WGIII SPM E.5.2, WGIII SPM E.5.3}
Scaling up ﬁnancial ﬂows requires clear signalling from 
governments and the international community (high conﬁdence). 
Tracked ﬁnancial ﬂows fall short of the levels needed for 
adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors and 
regions (high conﬁdence). These gaps create many opportunities 
and the challenge of closing gaps is largest in developing 
countries (high conﬁdence). This includes a stronger alignment of 
public ﬁnance, lowering real and perceived regulatory, cost and market 
barriers, and higher levels of public ﬁnance to lower the risks associated 
with low-emission investments. Up-front risks deter economically 
sound low carbon projects, and developing local capital markets are an 
option. Investors, ﬁnancial intermediaries, central banks and ﬁnancial 
regulators can shift the systemic underpricing of climate-related risks. A 
robust labelling of bonds and transparency is needed to attract savers. 
(high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.4, 
WGIII SPM E.5.4, WGIII 15.2, WGIII 15.6.1, WGIII 15.6.2, WGIII 15.6.7}
The largest climate ﬁnance gaps and opportunities are in 
developing countries (high conﬁdence). Accelerated support 
from developed countries and multilateral institutions is a critical 
enabler to enhance mitigation and adaptation action and can address 
inequities in ﬁnance, including its costs, terms and conditions, and 
economic vulnerability to climate change. Scaled-up public grants for 
mitigation and adaptation funding for vulnerable regions, e.g., in Sub-
Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and have high social returns 
in terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation 
and adaptation in developing regions include: increased levels of public 
ﬁnance and publicly mobilised private ﬁnance ﬂows from developed 
to developing countries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year 
goal of the Paris Agreement; increase the use of public guarantees 
to reduce risks and leverage private ﬂows at lower cost; local capital 
markets development; and building greater trust in international 
cooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-
pandemic recovery sustainable over the long term through increased 
ﬂows of ﬁnancing over this decade can accelerate climate action, 
including in developing regions facing high debt costs, debt distress 
and macroeconomic uncertainty. (high conﬁdence) {WGII SPM C.5.2, 
WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII SPM C.6.5, WGII SPM D.2, WGII TS.D.10.2; 
WGIII SPM E.5, WGIII SPM E.5.3, WGIII TS.6.4, WGIII Box TS.1, WGIII 15.2, 
WGIII 15.6} 
4.8.2. International Cooperation and Coordination 
International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving 
ambitious climate change mitigation goals and climate resilient 
development (high conﬁdence). Climate resilient development is 
enabled by increased international cooperation including mobilising 
and enhancing access to ﬁnance, particularly for developing countries, 
vulnerable regions, sectors and groups and aligning ﬁnance ﬂows 
for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding 
needs (high conﬁdence). While agreed processes and goals, such as 
those in the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, are helping 
(Section 2.2.1), international ﬁnancial, technology and capacity building 
support to developing countries will enable greater implementation 
and more ambitious actions (medium conﬁdence). By integrating 
equity and climate justice, national and international policies can help 
to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability, 
especially by mobilising and enhancing access to ﬁnance for vulnerable 
regions, sectors and communities (high conﬁdence). International 
cooperation and coordination, including combined policy packages, 
may be particularly important for sustainability transitions in emissions-
intensive and highly traded basic materials industries that are exposed 
to international competition (high conﬁdence). The large majority of 
emission modelling studies assume signiﬁcant international cooperation 
to secure ﬁnancial ﬂows and address inequality and poverty issues in 
pathways limiting global warming. There are large variations in the 
modelled effects of mitigation on GDP across regions, depending 
notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy 
design and level of international cooperation (high confidence). 
Delayed global cooperation increases policy costs across regions 
(high confidence). {WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.3.1, WGII SPM D.5.2; 
WGIII SPM D.3.4, WGIII SPM C5.4, WGIII SPM C.12.2, WGIII SPM E.6, 
WGIII SPM E.6.1, WGIII E.5.4, WGIII TS.4.2, WGIII TS.6.2; SR1.5 SPM D.6.3, 
SR1.5 SPM D.7, SR1.5 SPM D.7.3}
The transboundary nature of many climate change risks (e.g., for 
supply chains, markets and natural resource ﬂows in food, ﬁsheries, 
energy and water, and potential for conﬂict) increases the need 
for climate-informed transboundary management, cooperation, 
responses and solutions through multi-national or regional 
governance processes (high conﬁdence). Multilateral governance 
efforts can help reconcile contested interests, world views and values 
about how to address climate change. International environment and 
sectoral agreements, and initiatives in some cases, may help to stimulate 
low GHG investment and reduce emissions (such as ozone depletion, 
transboundary air pollution and atmospheric emissions of mercury). 
Improvements to national and international governance structures 
would further enable the decarbonisation of shipping and aviation 
through deployment of low-emissions fuels, for example through 
stricter efficiency and carbon intensity standards. Transnational 
partnerships can also stimulate policy development, low-emissions 
technology diffusion, emission reductions and adaptation, by linking sub-
national and other actors, including cities, regions, non-governmental 
organisations and private sector entities, and by enhancing interactions 
between state and non-state actors, though uncertainties remain over 
their costs, feasibility, and effectiveness. International environmental 
and sectoral agreements, institutions, and initiatives are helping, and 
in some cases may help, to stimulate low GHG emissions investment 
and reduce emissions. (medium conﬁdence) {WGII SPM B.5.3, WGII SPM

Enhancing 
technology 
innovation 
systems 
can 
provide 
opportunities to lower emissions growth and create social and 
environmental co-beneﬁts. Policy packages tailored to national 
contexts and technological characteristics have been effective 
in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. 
Support for successful low-carbon technological innovation 
includes public policies such as training and R&D, complemented by 
regulatory and market-based instruments that create incentives and 
market opportunities such as appliance performance standards and 
building codes. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.4, WGIII SPM B.4.4, 
WGIII SPM E.4.3, WGIII SPM E4.4}
International cooperation on innovation systems and technology 
development and transfer, accompanied by capacity building, 
knowledge sharing, and technical and ﬁnancial support can 
accelerate the global diffusion of mitigation technologies, 
practices and policies and align these with other development 
objectives (high conﬁdence). Choice architecture can help end-users 
adopt technology and low-GHG-intensive options (high conﬁdence). 
Adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, 
particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling 
conditions, including limited ﬁnance, technology development and 
transfer, and capacity building (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.4.2, 
WGIII SPM E.6.2, WGIII SPM C.10.4, WGIII 16.5}

Figure 4.6: Breakdown of average mitigation investment ﬂows and investment needs until 2030 (USD billion). Mitigation investment ﬂows and investment needs by 
sector (energy efﬁciency, transport, electricity, and agriculture, forestry and other land use), by type of economy, and by region (see WGIII Annex II Part I Section 1 for the classiﬁcation 
schemes for countries and areas). The blue bars display data on mitigation investment ﬂows for four years: 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 by sector and by type of economy. For the 
regional breakdown, the annual average mitigation investment ﬂows for 2017–2019 are shown. The grey bars show the minimum and maximum level of global annual mitigation 
investment needs in the assessed scenarios. This has been averaged until 2030. The multiplication factors show the ratio of global average early mitigation investment needs 
(averaged until 2030) and current yearly mitigation ﬂows (averaged for 2017/18–2020). The lower multiplication factor refers to the lower end of the range of investment needs. 
The upper multiplication factor refers to the upper range of investment needs. Given the multiple sources and lack of harmonised methodologies, the data can be considered only if 
indicative of the size and pattern of investment needs. {WGIII Figure TS.25, WGIII 15.3, WGIII 15.4, WGIII 15.5, WGIII Table 15.2, WGIII Table 15.3, WGIII Table 15.4}

International cooperation on innovation works best when tailored to 
and beneﬁcial for local value chains, when partners collaborate on an 
equal footing, and when capacity building is an integral part of the 
effort (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM E.4.4, WGIII SPM E.6.2}
Technological innovation can have trade-offs that include 
externalities such as new and greater environmental impacts and 
social inequalities; rebound effects leading to lower net emission 
reductions or even emission increases; and overdependence on 
foreign knowledge and providers (high conﬁdence). Appropriately 
designed policies and governance have helped address distributional 
impacts and rebound effects (high conﬁdence). For example, digital 
technologies can promote large increases in energy efﬁciency through 
coordination and an economic shift to services (high conﬁdence). 
However, societal digitalization can induce greater consumption of 
goods and energy and increased electronic waste as well as negatively 
impacting labour markets and worsening inequalities between 
and within countries (medium conﬁdence). Digitalisation requires 
appropriate governance and policies in order to enhance mitigation 
potential (high conﬁdence). Effective policy packages can help to 
realise synergies, avoid trade-offs and/or reduce rebound effects: 
these might include a mix of efﬁciency targets, performance standards, 
information provision, carbon pricing, ﬁnance and technical assistance 
(high conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM B.4.2, WGIII SPM B.4.3, WGIII SPM E.4.4, 
WGIII TS 6.5, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 11 on Digitalization in Chapter 16}
Technology transfer to expand use of digital technologies for land use 
monitoring, sustainable land management, and improved agricultural 
productivity supports reduced emissions from deforestation and land 
use change while also improving GHG accounting and standardisation 
(medium conﬁdence). {SRCCL SPM C.2.1, SRCCL SPM D.1.2, SRCCL SPM D.1.4, 
SRCCL 7.4.4, SRCCL 7.4.6}
Climate resilient development strategies that treat climate, 
ecosystems and biodiversity, and human society as parts of an 
integrated system are the most effective (high conﬁdence). Human 
and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent (high conﬁdence). 
Climate resilient development is enabled when decision-making processes 
and actions are integrated across sectors (very high conﬁdence). 
Synergies with and progress towards the Sustainable Development 
Goals enhance prospects for climate resilient development. Choices and 
actions that treat humans and ecosystems as an integrated system build 
on diverse knowledge about climate risk, equitable, just and inclusive 
approaches, and ecosystem stewardship. {WGII SPM B.2, WGII Figure 
SPM.5, WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D2.1, WGII SPM 2.2, WGII SPM D4, 
WGII SPM D4.1, WGII SPM D4.2, WGII SPM D5.2, WGII Figure SPM.5}
Approaches that align goals and actions across sectors provide 
opportunities for multiple and large-scale beneﬁts and avoided 
damages in the near term. Such measures can also achieve 
greater beneﬁts through cascading effects across sectors 
(medium conﬁdence). For example, the feasibility of using land for 
both agriculture and centralised solar production can increase when 
such options are combined (high conﬁdence). Similarly, integrated 
transport and energy infrastructure planning and operations can 
together reduce the environmental, social, and economic impacts of 
decarbonising the transport and energy sectors (high conﬁdence). The 
implementation of packages of multiple city-scale mitigation strategies 
can have cascading effects across sectors and reduce GHG emissions 
both within and outside a city’s administrative boundaries (very high 
conﬁdence). Integrated design approaches to the construction and 
retroﬁt of buildings provide increasing examples of zero energy or 
zero carbon buildings in several regions. To minimise maladaptation, 
multi-sectoral, multi-actor and inclusive planning with ﬂexible 
pathways encourages low-regret and timely actions that keep options 
open, ensure beneﬁts in multiple sectors and systems and suggest the 
available solution space for adapting to long-term climate change 
(very high conﬁdence). Trade-offs in terms of employment, water 
use, land-use competition and biodiversity, as well as access to, 
and the affordability of, energy, food, and water can be avoided 
by well-implemented land-based mitigation options, especially those 
that do not threaten existing sustainable land uses and land rights, with 
frameworks for integrated policy implementation (high conﬁdence). 
{WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.4.4; WGIII SPM C.6.3, WGIII SPM C.6, 
WGIII SPM C.7.2, WGIII SPM C.8.5, WGIII SPM D.1.2, WGIII SPM D.1.5, 
WGIII SPM E.1.2}
Mitigation and adaptation when implemented together, and 
combined with broader sustainable development objectives, 
would yield multiple beneﬁts for human well-being as well as 
ecosystem and planetary health (high conﬁdence). The range of 
such positive interactions is signiﬁcant in the landscape of near-term 
climate policies across regions, sectors and systems. For example, 
AFOLU mitigation actions in land-use change and forestry, when 
sustainably implemented, can provide large-scale GHG emission 
reductions and removals that simultaneously beneﬁt biodiversity, food 
security, wood supply and other ecosystem services but cannot fully 
compensate for delayed mitigation action in other sectors. Adaptation 
measures in land, ocean and ecosystems similarly can have widespread 
beneﬁts for food security, nutrition, health and well-being, ecosystems 
and biodiversity. Equally, urban systems are critical, interconnected 
sites for climate resilient development; urban policies that implement 
multiple interventions can yield adaptation or mitigation gains with 
equity and human well-being. Integrated policy packages can improve 
the ability to integrate considerations of equity, gender equality 
and justice. Coordinated cross-sectoral policies and planning can 
maximise synergies and avoid or reduce trade-offs between mitigation 
4.9 Integration of Near-Term Actions Across Sectors and Systems 
The feasibility, effectiveness and beneﬁts of mitigation and adaptation actions are increased when multi-sectoral 
solutions are undertaken that cut across systems. When such options are combined with broader sustainable 
development objectives, they can yield greater beneﬁts for human well-being, social equity and justice, and 
ecosystem and planetary health. (high conﬁdence)

and adaptation. Effective action in all of the above areas will 
require near-term political commitment and follow-through, social 
cooperation, ﬁnance, and more integrated cross-sectoral policies and 
support and actions. (high conﬁdence).  {WGII SPM C.1, WG II SPM C.2,
