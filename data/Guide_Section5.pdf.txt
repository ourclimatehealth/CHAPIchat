The Health Beneﬁts 
of Climate Action
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Taking action to address climate change can have signiﬁcant health beneﬁts that present important 
opportunities for addressing key public health issues. These health beneﬁts are often referred to as 
“cobeneﬁts.” “Cobeneﬁts are the public health (or other) beneﬁts associated with GHGE reductions, 
independent of reductions to global warming.”1 Cobeneﬁts provide a framework for intersectoral 
partnerships and increased support for climate mitigation.
5.1 Transportation
Transportation systems determine how people and goods get from place to place, and impact access to jobs, 
school, and essential services and resources. Today’s transportation system causes injury and illness from air 
pollution, motor vehicle collisions, sedentary behavior, noise, and stress. Current land use, transportation, and 
housing patterns have increased our dependence on automobiles. Historical investments in road infrastructure 
and inadequate investments in public transit and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure have resulted in a vehicle-
centric transportation system that will require investment and behavior change to become a healthy and climate-
friendly transportation system.
• 
Transportation is the largest source of GHGE in the U.S., accounting for 28.5% of emissions. 
• 
Low-income families spend more of their income on transportation, have more exposure to 
vehicle pollution, and are at higher risk of injury and death due to collisions.
• 
Car-dependent land use, housing and transportation patterns increase sedentary lifestyles, 
increasing premature mortality and many chronic disease risks. 
• 
Reduced car use is a priority, yielding signiﬁcant health and climate beneﬁts, such as increased 
physical activity and reduced emissions.
• 
Reduce transportation-related emissions through low and zero emission vehicles, low carbon 
fuels, and clean freight, also reduces respiratory and cardiovascular disease
Key Messages
Transportation and Climate Change 
The transportation sector is now the largest (and fastest growing) source of U.S. GHGs; in 2016, it caused 28.5% 
of all U.S. GHG emissions.2 The majority (82.7%) of U.S. transportation-related GHG emissions are attributable 
to cars, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty freight vehicles.3 Other GHGE sources include cement production and 
roadway impacts on deforestation.4

TRANSPORTATION AND DESIGN
Impacts on Climate Change and Health
Driving releases harmful 
pollutants into the environment.  
People both inside and outside the 
vehicle are exposed.
CLIMATE IMPACTS:
Increases Trafﬁc, Increases Pollution
HEALTH IMPACTS:
Decreases physical activity 
Increases chronic disease risk 
Worsens existing chronic disease
AUTOMOTIVE TRANSPORTATION
Many people can be transported at once 
via mass transit, reducing vehicles on 
roads. This form of transportation also 
encourages walking between stops 
 
and destinations.
CLIMATE IMPACTS:
Reduces Trafﬁc, Reduces Pollution
HEALTH IMPACTS:
Increases physical activity (slightly) 
Increases safety, Decreases stress 
Increases social interaction
MASS/PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
Walking, biking, and rolling to the places we 
need to go is termed active transportation. 
People who have options to reach their 
destinations without driving can have more 
active lifestyles. Active lifestyles promote 
healthier lives.
CLIMATE IMPACTS:
Reduces Trafﬁc, Reduces Pollution
HEALTH IMPACTS:

THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Transportation and Health
Too little physical activity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, depression and 
all-cause mortality. As of 2017, only one-third of people in the U.S. regularly achieved recommended moderate 
physical activity levels.5 Exposure to trafﬁc related air pollutants increases the risk for heart disease, asthma and 
other respiratory disease, cancer, premature death, adverse birth outcomes, diabetes, and affects lung and brain 
development in children.6 Motor vehicles crashes are the top cause of injury, disability, and death in the U.S. for 
5–24 year olds.7 Long commutes and trafﬁc increase stress and isolation from family and community.8 Pavement 
contributes to urban heat islands (See Section 5.4—Urban Greening).9 
Transportation and Health Equity 
Low-income individuals and people of color are more likely to live near busy roadways and face disproportionate 
impacts of motor vehicle pollution.10,11 Low-income people, people of color and children face greater risk of death 
and injury due to motor vehicle crashes.12,13 Low-income families often have few low-cost transportation options, 
and almost 30% of their income goes to transportation.14  
Reducing Transport-Related Climate Pollution and Improving Health
One of the best ways to improve our health and reduce climate pollution is to spend less time driving cars and 
more time using “active transportation”—walking, biking, and using public transit. Modest shifts in travel mode 
from car travel to active transportation provide big reductions in chronic disease.
• 
Nearly 28% of all trips in urban areas are less than one mile, easy bicycling distance.15 
• 
Walking, biking, and public transit must be safe to ensure that expanding active transportation doesn’t 
lead to more injuries. In 2015, approximately 18% of automobile crash fatalities included pedestrians and 
bicyclists.16 
• 
“Complete Streets” make streets friendly for all users; better road and sidewalk design, segregated bike 
lanes, lighting, shade, and bike parking make biking and walking safer and more pleasant.17  
• 
Programs such as “Safe Routes to School” allow parents to feel that children can safely use active 
transportation to get to school.18 
Due to the high cost of driving, low-income people are more frequent users of active transportation. Better 
service, safety, affordability, and accessibility allows low-income people, youth, seniors and the disabled better 
access to resources and opportunities. Free or discounted public transit fees for students also increase school 
attendance and decrease contact with the juvenile justice system.19
Zero-emission vehicles and hybrid low carbon vehicles reduce air pollution and climate pollution. Zero-
emission vehicles (battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell) produce zero tailpipe smog-forming or greenhouse gas 
emissions. Using today’s average U.S. electricity mix of renewable and non-renewable resources, an electric car 
will cut harmful carbon pollution by about half compared to the average new vehicle.20
Low carbon fuel standards and automobile fuel efﬁciency standards reduce air pollution and climate pollution. 
The EPA’s Low Carbon Fuel Standards Program 2017–2025 model year light-duty vehicles are projected to save 
approximately 2 billion metric tons of GHGs over the lifetimes of the vehicles; however, in May 2018, the EPA 
proposed a roll back on these cleaner car standards.21,22

What Local Health Departments Can Do
Local health departments can play a critical role in moving toward a healthy, equitable, and climate-friendly 
transportation system.
Assessment and Surveillance
See Section 7.1—Surveillance
• 
Implement walkability and bikeability assessments, noting sidewalk width, shared and protected bike 
lanes, crosswalks and walk signs, aesthetics and shading, and connectivity and accessibility of sidewalks 
and bike routes.23 Multiple tools are available to assess streetscape design and walkability, including the 
Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes-Mini Tool.24  
• 
Conduct health assessments to identify health beneﬁts and potential health harms of transportation 
policies and programs proposed during the development of city and county Climate Action Plans, General 
and Speciﬁc Plans, Regional Transportation Plans, Bike and Pedestrian Master Plans, and others. 
 
The Clackamas County Public Health Division in Oregon partnered with the county’s Department 
of Transportation and Development to conduct a Health Impact Assessment, which prompted the 
agencies to recommend that the county build more sidewalks, improve lighting along paths, and 
enhance safety mechanisms at cross-walks.25  
• 
Use available data to show the health impacts of transportation in your community, including the 
disproportionate impacts on children, low-income communities, and people of color.
• 
Use the Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model (ITHIM) to quantify the health beneﬁts and 
harms of different transportation planning scenarios or mobility goals and vehicle miles traveled 
reduction targets.26  
• 
Assess the health impacts and beneﬁts of shifts in transportation technology and infrastructure, including 
shifts from gas and diesel motor vehicles and trucks to low or zero emission vehicles and anti-idling 
ordinances.27 
81
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Intersectoral Collaboration
See Section 7.3—Collaboration
Collaborate with planners, zoning, transportation agencies, and school districts to support:28,29   
• 
Active transportation programs and infrastructure, including Complete Streets, safe routes to school, bike 
lanes, bike shares, segregated bike lanes, safe pedestrian sidewalks, trafﬁc calming, and signage, lighting 
and shading on biking and walking paths.
 
In Alexandria, VA, the health department was part of a cross-agency partnership to implement a 
58-step action plan to expand Safe Routes to School and eliminate all trafﬁc-related fatalities and 
serious injuries by 2028.30  
 
In Helena, Montana, the local public health department collaborated with parks, public transit, 
and other community stakeholders to improve access to the trail system, creating a free trolley 
system for youth to access trails, pools, parks, libraries, and other activities.31  
• 
Investments in transit infrastructure, maintenance, and access, including reduced transit fares/passes for 
students and low-income people.
• 
School siting in walkable, bikeable, transit-friendly locations.
Work with local planning, housing, transportation, and community development agencies and community- based 
organizations to support policies that encourage density and mixed land use to allow more people to live closer 
to jobs, schools, services, and parks, including inﬁll and transit-oriented development. 
• 
Anti-displacement measures and affordable housing are critical to ensure that low-income residents are not 
displaced through gentriﬁcation, as “smart growth” and new amenities may increase property values.32 
• 
Promote inclusion of trees, parks and green space, and space for community gardens.
Provide health evidence and data to support: 
• 
Lower speed limits. 
• 
Strengthening of low carbon fuel standards and vehicle efﬁciency standards. 
• 
Strategies to increase the use of electric vehicles such as electriﬁcation infrastructure and ﬁnancial 
incentives, including mechanisms that allow low-income populations to beneﬁt from electric vehicle 
ownership, such as enhanced rebates and charging stations in multi-unit housing.33 
Community Engagement and Education
See Sections 7.2—Engagement and 8—Communications
• 
Educate communities on the health and climate beneﬁts of active transport and provide resources 
regarding local bike share programs and bike lanes, walking paths, and public transit.34 
• 
Inform local decision makers about the connections among transportation, climate change, health,  
and equity. 
• 
Promote pedestrian and bicycle safety 
82
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
• 
Provide opportunities for community residents—especially youth and seniors—to conduct walkability 
assessments.
 
In 2007, the Iowa Department of Public Health developed a tool for local health departments 
across the state to use in assessing the walkability of their communities. Thirteen communities 
utilized the tool, and many of these communities went on to engage city ofﬁcials on improving 
active transport infrastructure.35 
• 
Support community based organizations that advocate for active transportation

5.2 Energy and Fossil Fuels
Electricity generation is responsible for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), almost all of which is 
associated with the burning of dirty fossil fuels (Figure 5.2.1).1 Fossil fuels—coal, oil, and gas—are fuels that 
were formed when prehistoric plants and animals died and were gradually buried by layers of rock.2 As of 2017, 
coal provides 30.1% of U.S. electricity, although its use is declining due to the cheap cost of natural gas.3 A 
signiﬁcant reduction in our reliance on fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, heating and other uses of energy 
is vital to make progress in ﬁghting climate change.
• 
Switching from coal combustion and other fossil fuels to clean, safe, renewable energy—like 
wind, solar and hydroelectric—is essential for our health and for the climate. 
• 
Energy efﬁciency and clean renewable energy have substantial beneﬁts for health, including 
reductions in asthma and other respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and premature deaths. 
• 
Energy production is the largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., responsible for nearly 
1/3 of greenhouse gas emissions. 
• 
Coal-ﬁred power plants release 3.5 million tons of CO2 per year, the most signiﬁcant climate 
pollutant. 
• 
Energy production is a major source of air, water, and soil pollution, and harms our health.
• 
Air pollution from burning coal causes over 13,000 deaths and 20,000 heart attacks in the U.S.  
each year. 
• 
Increased energy efﬁciency (in homes, ofﬁces, and industry) allows us to meet our energy needs 
at lower cost and with less climate and air pollution.

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Figure 5.2.1: Types of fuels used in electricity production
Energy and Climate Change
Coal
Coal combustion is a major source of GHGE and of toxic air pollutants.4 Coal produces more carbon dioxide per 
unit of energy than any other energy source, producing nearly 68% of CO2 from U.S. electricity production but 
only 30% of electricity.5,6 Coal mining releases methane—a potent short-lived climate pollutant with a global 
warming potential far higher than that of CO2—and contaminates land, water, and soil in nearby communities.7  
Oil 
Oil well exploration, offshore oil platform, and oil well production operations and reﬁnery processes result 
in signiﬁcant CO2 and methane emissions.8,9,10 Transporting oil by truck, rail, or marine vessels also results in 
signiﬁcant CO2 emissions.11 
Natural Gas
Natural gas has been proposed as a “bridge fuel,” producing signiﬁcantly lower CO2 emissions than coal.12 But 
recent ﬁndings suggest that the methane released during the lifecycle of natural gas use may have a climate 
impact even greater than that of coal. Methane is a potent short-lived climate pollutant with a global warming 
potential far higher than that of CO2.13,14 In 2011, leaks from high pressure natural gas pipelines resulted in 
emissions equivalent to 33.3 million metric tons of CO2 (or the CO2 emissions from 6-7 millions cars.15 
85
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Renewable Energy
Across their life cycles, renewable energy sources produce signiﬁcantly less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. A 
study of new renewable energy resources implemented across the U.S. in 2013 found that these additions resulted 
in emissions reduced by 59 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent and $0.7 billion to $6.3 billion in beneﬁts for 
that year.17  
Other Considerations
Globally, oil, gas, and mineral extraction account for an estimated 7% of deforestation in the subtropics, which 
releases stored CO2 and removes an important global carbon sink.18,19    
In order to have at least a 50% chance of staying within 2°C of global warming above pre-industrial 
levels, cumulative carbon emissions between 2011and 2050 need to be limited to 1,100 gigatonnes 
of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2,). The emissions embedded in available fossil fuel reserves are around 
three times that amount. A recent study demonstrates that, “globally, a third of oil reserves, half 
of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in 
order to meet a target of 2°C.”  
Use of fossil fuel reserves must be limited 
to stay within 2°C warming 
Energy and Health
A switch from dirty fossil fuels to renewable energy will result in signiﬁcant reductions in illness and deaths.21 
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that states that reduced fossil fuel 
energy production through new renewable energy systems saw health beneﬁts and savings.22 The full life cycles 
of these fuels includes extraction, processing, storage, transportation and use, each with signiﬁcant climate, 
health, and equity impacts.
In October 2015, the largest methane leak in U.S. history occurred at the Aliso Canyon natural gas 
storage facility in Los Angeles County, California, releasing over 100,000 metric tons of methane. 
Thousands of families were evacuated from their homes, and many nearby residents suffered from 
symptoms such as nausea and headaches that the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health 
(LADPH) linked to exposure to high levels of mercaptans—odorants used in natural gas.  
Researchers at the University of Southern California School of Medicine have raised concern about 
exposures to contaminants and byproducts such as hydrogen sulﬁde, benzene, and other volatile 
organic compounds.

Coal
• 
Coal mining can cause signiﬁcant water contamination and mudslides.23,24   
• 
Coal miners suffer from debilitating occupational hazards, such as black lung disease, injuries and 
fatalities.25,26   
• 
Coal is generally uncovered when stored or transported, resulting in signiﬁcant increases in the 
concentrations of ﬁne airborne particulates within 25 miles of the storage site or transportation line. 
Processing coal for export or use also creates coal dust.27 
• 
Coal air pollution is also associated with heart disease, asthma, and chronic lung disease, with the 
greatest impacts on children, the elderly, low-income communities, people of color, and communities 
downwind of power plants.28,29,30,31       
• 
Burning coal to produce electricity releases tons of toxic chemicals into the air, including nitrogen oxides, 
sulfur oxides and particulate matter (PM).32 Coal power plants are the largest single source of mercury 
that pollutes waterways and contaminates the ﬁsh we eat. It is a potent neurotoxin that can cause 
developmental problems and learning disabilities, particularly in fetuses and young children.33  
• 
The cumulative health costs of coal-based electricity in the U.S. have been estimated to fall between $62 
billion and $523 billion annually.34 
As reservoirs of oil and gas continue to deplete, 
producers have turned to “unconventional” 
extraction methods such as hydraulic fracturing 
to tap reserves trapped in deep shale rock 
formations. Fracking releases signiﬁcantly more 
methane than conventional extraction. The 
process requires huge quantities of water, which 
may enter surface and groundwater. Improper 
disposal of fracking water and inadequate 
treatment of wastewater can contaminate water 
used for drinking and crop irrigation.  Workers at 
these sites are potentially exposed to chemicals in 
fracking ﬂuids and high levels of crystalline silica 
in frack sand. Unconventional extraction processes can destabilize geologic formations causing 
sinkholes and earthquakes. Sites are often constructed in previously unexploited environments, 
introducing air quality, toxics, and noise concerns for surrounding communities from industrial 
activity, construction, and diesel transport emissions. 
Drilling and fracking involves over 900 products containing over 600 chemicals, few of which have 
been fully characterized from a toxicological perspective. Physicians for Social Responsibility and 
Concerned Health Professionals of New York released a Compendium that summarizes hundreds of 
studies on the health impacts of unconventional oil and gas extraction, ranging from air and water 
quality issues to worker health, noise, earthquakes, and radioactive releases.

THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Other Energy Sources 
• 
Natural gas extraction, storage, and transport emit methane, large concentrations of which may displace 
oxygen, causing dizziness, weakness, nausea, and vomiting.35 
 
In the past 30 years there have been approximately 9,000 ‘signiﬁcant’ pipeline-related incidents 
across the U.S. with resultant 548 deaths, 2,576 injuries, and approximately $8.5 billion in 
ﬁnancial damages36 
 
Underground storage of natural gas presents risks of explosions, ﬁres, routine toxic air-pollutant 
emissions, and leaks.37 
 
Gas extraction, storage, and combustion may also release benzene, which has been associated 
with leukemia, and other volatile organic compounds, which contribute to the formation ground-
level ozone (smog).38,39   
• 
Oil production processes release cancer-causing and smog-forming chemicals and particulate matter 
including diesel exhaust and silica dust.45 
 
People living in fence-line communities near oil and gas drilling sites have higher risks for cancer, 
increased asthma attacks and other respiratory problems, and emerging evidence of increased 
risks of adverse reproductive and neurodevelopmental outcomes.46,47    
 
In 2010, oil reﬁneries reported approximately 22,000 tons of hazardous air pollution to the 
Environmental Protection Agency.48 
• 
The use of nuclear power poses a very small risk of accidental releases of radiation, though accidental 
releases could be catastrophic.49 Nuclear workers face risks from chronic low-level radiation exposure, 
with attendant cancer risks, and uranium miners have a high risk of lung cancer.50  
Energy and Health Equity
The greatest impacts of energy-related air pollution affect children, the elderly, low-income communities, people 
of color and communities downwind of power plants.
• 
Coal power plants are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color; 
nearly six million African Americans live within three miles of a coal-ﬁred power plant.65,66     
• 
Over 1 million African Americans live in counties that face a cancer risk above EPA’s level of concern 
from toxins emitted by natural gas facilities.67  
• 
For many low-income families, “fuel poverty” due to high energy costs means choosing between paying 
for energy to cook, heat, or cool homes, versus other essential necessities such as food.68  
• 
Fuel poverty is associated with increased risk for cold-related illness, and use of unsafe heat sources  
that can cause carbon monoxide poisoning or ﬁres.69 Globally, lack of access to energy leads to 3.8 
million premature deaths associated with household air pollution from burning solid fuels and kerosene 
for cooking.70 
• 
Concerns about high-energy costs may reduce the use of air conditioning during heat waves, increasing 
the risk of heat illness and deaths among low-income families. 18% of households below the poverty line 
do not have air conditioning).71 
88
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Health and Emerging Electricity Technologies
A transition to clean energy brings signiﬁcant climate and health beneﬁts because greenhouse gas 
emissions across the life cycle of renewables are far less than those from fossil fuels.52,53
However, the potential health risks of emerging electricity technologies should not be ignored. 
• 
Solar Photovoltaics
o 
Exposures to toxic dust and chemicals during material extraction and manufacturing 
stages, much of which occurs outside of the U.S.54
o 
Disposal of solar photovoltaics (also likely to be offshored) may pose toxics exposure 
risks; research into safe and sustainable recycling and disposal is needed.55 
• 
Wind  
o 
Current data does not support a causal relationship between wind turbine noise, 
infrasound, and vibration—symptoms common to reports of “wind turbine syndrome.”
o 
Wind turbine noise exposure has been associated with sleep disruption and annoyance.
• 
Biomass
o 
Long-distance transport of biomass feedstocks entails diesel emissions related to goods 
movement that may be avoided with small, distributed systems.57
o 
Alternative fates of feedstock—e.g. wildﬁre, open burning, or landﬁlls—may be 
associated with health risks such as smoke exposure and displacement.58
o 
Emissions from the energy conversion process pose health risks that have been 
inadequately characterized.59
• 
Geothermal 
o 
Occupational exposures to hydrogen sulﬁde are of concern.60
o 
Leaks from liquid and solid waste streams may cause water contamination.61
• 
Storage Technologies
o 
Electrochemical battery storage systems require use of rare and potentially hazardous 
materials that pose both chemical and ﬁre risks throughout their life cycle.62
Emerging electricity generating and storage systems employ a myriad of workers across technology 
life cycles; more work is needed to ensure that these jobs are healthy and safe, provide career 
development, and pay living wages.63
Utility scale facilities may offer community economic development opportunities, but these should 
not detract from efforts to reduce related air pollutant emissions, particularly in communities 
already burdened with poor air quality.64 
89
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Reducing Reliance on Fossil Fuel Energy 
Switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy is a critical path to the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions. Electricity generated from renewables releases about 1/20th the GHGE of coal over the full life cycle.75 
Advances in renewable energy technology have made renewable energy ever more cost-competitive and increased 
market shares.76 
• 
In 2016, renewable electricity accounted for 67% of U.S. electricity capacity additions, growing from 64% 
in 2015, and coal-ﬁred plants accounts for 80% of facility closures.77 
 
U.S. wind energy increased by more than 11%, and U.S. solar energy increased by 52% in 2016.78 
Energy efﬁciency and energy conservation are important for tackling climate change. They reduce the need for 
energy production and thus reduce GHGEs and air pollution, helping to reduce the health and climate impacts 
mentioned above.79,80,81      
• 
Energy efﬁciency also reduces energy costs and saves money, a beneﬁt especially for those on ﬁxed or 
low incomes.82,83     
• 
Programs are available to ensure that energy efﬁciency upgrades are available to those who need them 
the most: Low Income Home Energy Efﬁciency Plan (LIHEAP) and the Weatherization Assistance 
Program (WAP).84,85   
• 
Key strategies for energy efﬁciency include zero net energy homes and commercial buildings; industry 
adoption of energy efﬁciency; deployment of energy-efﬁcient appliances and light bulbs; strengthened 
energy efﬁciency standards for buildings and appliances.
 
Energy efﬁciency measures that tighten the building envelope need to ensure adequate ventilation 
to maintain healthy indoor air quality. 
Just Transition
In order to equitably transition to decrease the country’s reliance on fossil fuels, there must be 
policies for a “just transition” for workers currently employed in the fossil fuel industry.
“A just transition brings together workers, communities, employers and government in social 
dialogue to drive the concrete plans, policies and investments needed for a fast and fair 
transformation. It focuses on jobs, livelihoods and ensuring that no one is left behind as we 
race to reduce emissions, protect the climate and advance social and economic justice.”72 
Strategies include investments to retain and create good jobs, modernizing industry, 
apprenticeship, education, training programs for renewable energy jobs, and providing assistance 
for any workers and families who may be adversely affected.73 Chicago IBEW Local 134 is building a 
renewable energy training facility for IBEW electricians across the U.S. to train for jobs in the new 
green economy. The site will have wind, photovoltaic, building automation, and smart metering 
facilities and training programs. 74

What Local Health Departments Can Do
Assessment and Surveillance
See Section 7.1—Surveillance  
Provide data, mapping, and analysis that layers health and social vulnerability information with information 
about current or projected air and water pollution related to fossil fuel use and production. 
Conduct health impact assessments of proposals for new or expanded fossil fuel extraction, processing, storage, 
and transportation in your jurisdiction.
• 
The New York Department of Health conducted a review of high volume hydraulic fracturing that 
bolstered the Governor’s decision to ban fracking throughout the state.86 
• 
Green River District Health Department in Kentucky completed an HIA on three proposed coal

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
5.3 Agriculture and Food Systems
Food and agriculture systems have signiﬁcant impacts on climate change, the environment, and our health. Our 
food and agriculture systems account for approximately one-third of all U.S. GHG emissions and are driving 
increased consumption foods associated with chronic illness.1,2,3    
Shifting to healthy diets and local, sustainable food and agriculture systems offer signiﬁcant health, 
climate, and environmental beneﬁts.4  
 
Local food systems increase access to healthy fruits and vegetables.5 
 
Eating less red and processed meat reduces the risk of heart disease and cancer 6 and 
reduces methane emissions from livestock production.  
 
Sustainable agricultural practices conserve water, reduce pesticide and fertilizer use, protect 
topsoil, and sequester (store) carbon.7  
• 
Reducing food waste and food waste diversion can reduce food insecurity and climate pollution 
at the same time.8  
• 
Poor nutrition - especially overconsumption of calorie-dense foods and meat - is a leading cause 
of illness in the U.S., associated with diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.9,10   
• 
Agriculture is a signiﬁcant source of methane and nitrous oxide, extremely potent climate-
warming gases. It is responsible for 8.6% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and about a 
third of global GHGE.11 
• 
Industrial agricultural practices are also associated with antibiotic resistance, water 
contamination, pesticide illness, and topsoil loss.12,13,14      
• 
Climate change will reduce worldwide food production through adverse impacts on crop yields 
and ﬁsheries.15 This will increase food insecurity and associated risks of chronic illness and 
under-nutrition.
Key Messages
Agriculture and Climate Change
In 2016, agriculture was responsible for 8.6% of U.S. total GHG emissions, including 36% of the country’s 
methane emissions.16 
• 
Factoring in fertilizer use, food refrigeration, food transport, and agriculture-related deforestation and soil 
depletion, food and agriculture systems account for about one- third of all U.S. GHG emissions.17 
• 
Food production and processing account for 17% of U.S. fossil fuel use.18 In the food industry, food 
production accounts for 83% of carbon emissions.19 
• 
Nitrogen fertilizer accounts for ~80% of U.S. nitrous oxide emissions.20

Urban Farming in San Francisco
VitusKonter, 2010
• 
40% of food (valued at $165 billion) is wasted annually, and the 30 million tons of food that goes to 
landﬁlls releases 23% of U.S. methane emissions.21 
• 
Destroying rainforests for cattle feed is eliminating carbon reservoirs and watersheds.22 
• 
1 kg beef equates to roughly the same GHGE emissions as 160 highway miles in a mid-size car.23,24    
Climate change is adversely impacting agriculture and food production (See Section 4.8—Food Security).
• 
Extreme heat, drought, and precipitation and higher ozone levels decrease crop yields.25,26,27   
• 
Higher temperatures and drought reduce milk and egg production.28 
• 
Warmer temperatures increase the risk of food contamination.29  
• 
Increased atmospheric CO2 reduces the protein and micronutrient content of key crops.30  
• 
Extreme weather events can disrupt food transportation and supply chains.31 
• 
Global food production will decrease by an estimated 2% per decade due to climate change, while global 
food demand increases by 14% per decade.32  
 
Climate change has increased the number of malnourished children by 7–20% globally.33 
Agriculture and Health 
Poor diet and nutrition are leading causes of illness and death, increasing diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular 
disease, and cancer.34  
• 
Only 1 in 10 U.S. adults eat the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables per day35,36   
• 
Access to healthy affordable food is limited for low-income households and communities, exacerbating 
health inequities.37,38    
• 
U.S. consumption of meat, high-fat, high-salt foods, and sugar has radically increased over several 
decades, driven by corn and soy subsidies.39,40      
94
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
• 
Industrial agricultural practices are associated with antibiotic resistance, water contamination, and 
pesticide-related impacts.41,42,43     
 
Nitrogen fertilizers and animal waste contaminate groundwater with nitrates, which is associated 
with “blue baby” syndrome.44,45,46     
 
Pesticides cause acute illness in farmworkers and their children, increasing cancer, reproductive 
defects, and neurological and cognitive deﬁcits.47 
• 
Environmental and crop degradation from climate change and industrial agriculture increases risk for 
food insecurity, chronic illness and under-nutrition.48 
Climate Change, Meat Consumption, and Health 
Meat consumption in the U.S. has doubled over the last century. Diets heavy in red and processed meat have 
been linked to higher rates of heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and earlier death.49 
Meat production, processing, distribution and retailing accounts for 9% of U.S. and 15% of global GHG.50 Animal 
agriculture accounts for 42% of agricultural emissions in the U.S.; worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 
percent and 18 percent of human-induced GHGE.51 A recent study found that there is an 8-fold difference in GHGE 
associated with vegetarian and meat-based individual diets, 72% of which is due to increased beef intake.52 
Industrial animal farming practices have devastating environmental impacts. Communities surrounding 
concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)—frequently low-income communities and communities of 
color—often have poor air quality with high levels of hydrogen sulﬁde and ammonia and increased rates of 
asthma, respiratory illness, depression, and anxiety.53 These operations are also associated with local water 
contamination from excessive nutrient runoff, antibiotics, and microbial pathogens.54 CAFO antibiotic use 
accounts for 70% of U.S. antibiotics use and is a key contributor to increasing antibiotic resistance.55,56,57 A third 
of global arable land is used to grow animal feed, accounting for nearly 70% of the world’s deforestation58 In the 
U.S., crops such as corn and soybeans receive tens of billions of dollars in subsidies. The vast majority of these 
crops are used for feed in livestock operations.59  
Reducing meat consumption and eating a more plant-based diet could:60   
• 
Reduce global mortality from chronic disease by 6–10%. 
• 
Reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70%. 
• 
Save $1–31 trillion overall by improving diets.
Agriculture and Health Equity
Climate impacts will exacerbate lack of access to and affordability of safe water and fresh produce for many low-
income families and communities of color.61  
• 
Food insecurity increases as food prices rise; pushing low-income households to choose cheaper, low-
nutrient, processed foods associated with higher risks for diabetes, hypertension and obesity.62,63  
• 
Food insecurity is more common in people of color. In 2016, 12.3% of U.S. households were food 
insecure: 22.5% of Black households and 18.5% of Hispanic households versus 9.3% of White 
households.64  
95
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Agricultural workers are at high risk for climate-related health impacts, such as heat illness and vector borne 
disease.65 
Declines in food production result in signiﬁcant job and economic losses in farming communities. 
• 
80% of U.S. farmworkers identify as Hispanic and just over half are documented, leaving many members 
of this community especially vulnerable to economic and health impacts of climate change.66 
Indigenous communities that practice traditional hunting, subsistence farming and ﬁshing are vulnerable to 
climate change impacts on game, farming and aquatic habitats, particularly in coastal communities where rising 
sea level threatens ﬁshing habitats.67 
Reducing Food-Related Climate Pollution and Improving Health
Improvements in food production and distribution, reduced food waste and eating less meat will reduce climate 
and environmental pollution and improve health. 
• 
The use of available sustainable agricultural practices (e.g. better crop management, reduced fertilizer 
use, soil and degraded land restoration, improved manure management, increased water efﬁciency) could 
reduce agricultural GHGE by 5–14%, while increasing soil productivity and carbon storage and reducing 
soil erosion and water contamination.68,69,70,71,72          
• 
Eating less meat and more fruits and vegetables would decrease greenhouse gas emissions and yield 
substantial health beneﬁts.73,74,75,76,77         
• 
Reductions in the use of pesticides and antibiotics would reduce pesticide related illness and water 
contamination, improve worker safety, and decrease antibiotic resistance.78   
• 
Sustainable local food systems can reduce the use of fossil fuels in food transport, processing, packaging, 
and storage, increase access to healthy fruits and vegetables; build social capital, and improve mental 
health.79 (See Figure 5.3.1)

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
What Local Health Departments Can Do
Public health has a critical role in building healthy, equitable, sustainable, and climate resilient communities. 
Assessment and Surveillance
See Section 7.1—Surveillance 
Assess and map food insecurity and local/regional food system assets in your community. See: CX381, Map the 
Meal Gap82, Local Food System Asset Mapping83, and Healthier Food Retail: Beginning the Assessment Process in 
Your State or Community.84  
• 
Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties (CO) collaborated to assess local food systems in their rural regions, 
including marketing of agricultural products, shopping habits, food distribution, access to food, and 
nutrition assistance programs, and community gardens.85  
Intersectoral Collaboration
See Section 7.3—Collaboration  
Collaborate with Environmental Health, Planning, agricultural agencies, school districts, businesses, institutions 
such as hospitals, and community-based organizations to support local and sustainable food systems, including:
• 
Expansion of community and school gardens, urban and peri-urban agriculture, farmer’s markets, 
mobile fruit and vegetable vending, “farm-to-fork” programs, food hubs, and conservation of regional 
agricultural lands.  
 
Prince George Public Health in Maryland started a farmer’s market, collaborating with local 
parks, businesses, and media outlets to procure space and grants to cover vendors’ liability 
insurance and WIC certiﬁcation.86 
• 
Removal of legal and zoning barriers and promotion of incentives for businesses and organizations 
growing and selling healthy foods.87   
• 
Preservation of agricultural land and natural habitats.
• 
Sustainable agricultural practices such as water conservation, better management of livestock production, 
and practices that reduce soil degradation and the use of fossil fuel based inputs such as pesticides and 
synthetic fertilizers (e.g. a fee on nitrogen fertilizers).88,89,90,91       
• 
Reduction of federal subsidies for commodity crops (e.g. corn and soy) and increase in subsidies for 
production of healthy and sustainably grown foods.
Collaborate across departments and with other agencies and community organizations to increase access to 
affordable healthy foods.
• 
Expand the use of SNAP EBT and ﬁnancial incentives at farmer’s market coupons or mobile fruit and 
vegetable vendors.92 
 
In Kent County, Michigan, the health department supported the local YMCA in creating a “Veggie 
Van” to provide urban neighborhoods in Grand Rapids year-round, daily access to fruits and 
vegetables from local farmers, sold at reduced prices. The Veggie Van accepts EBT, SNAP, WIC, 
and Senior Project Fresh/Market FRESH beneﬁts.93 
97
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Encourage local health care providers and pharmacies to establish healthy food prescription programs that refer 
people to community resources to support healthy eating.94  
Encourage procurement of healthy and local foods by institutions such as hospitals, schools, businesses, and 
government agencies.95 The Kentucky Department of Public Health created the “Better Bites” programs at three 
state department cafeterias to offer healthy, local meal options and smaller portion sizes, along with related 
trainings and educational resource.96 
Reduce food waste and food insecurity by promoting surplus food diversion and gleaning programs in 
collaboration with community groups.97 
• 
Increase donations of healthy and usable food from hospitals, restaurants, and groceries to food banks 
and pantries.98  
• 
Train Environmental Health Specialists on climate change, food waste, and food insecurity. Adapt and 
disseminate the Safe Surplus Food Donation Best Management Practices and the Safe Surplus Food 
Donation Toolkit for food facilities during normal routine inspections
Collaborate with Agricultural Extension and local agricultural organizations to educate growers and agricultural 
operations about agriculture-climate change-health connections. 
Community Engagement and Education
See Section 7.2—Engagement  
Inform the public and local decision-makers about the connections among food systems, food waste, climate 
change, health, and equity. 
Conduct campaigns and programs with schools, businesses, agencies, and communities to reduce consumption 
of meat, processed foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages— for example “Meatless Mondays” and “Rethink Your 
Drink”—and to reduce food waste.99,100   
Work with community groups and stakeholders to implement and support a Food Policy Council.101  
• 
The Cleveland Department of Public Health worked collaboratively with diverse stakeholders to create the 
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Food Policy Coalition to build a just, equitable, healthy and sustainable food 
system through policy  change and capacity building.102 
Train youth and community members to collect neighborhood level data on food quality, availability and 
affordability in low-income communities, using a tool such as CX3.103  
• 
Support use of data to inform policy makers and institutions about opportunities to improve local food 
system and healthy food access. 
• 
Look for opportunities to integrate climate change into nutrition education, information on food 
insecurity, and materials that address meat consumption and food waste reduction. 
 
San Luis Obisbo, CA integrated climate change education into its OutsideIn SLO nutrition 
materials.104

5.4 Urban Greening and Green Infrastructure
Urban heat islands are areas in cities with many buildings, lots of dark surfaces such as pavement and asphalt, 
and fewer trees, parks, and green space.1 In these “urban heat islands,” daytime temperatures are on average 
1-6°F higher than in surrounding more suburban and rural areas. Nighttime temperatures can be as much as 
22°F higher as the heat is gradually released from buildings and pavement.2 Climate change is projected to 
increase average summer temperatures and cause more frequent, more severe, and longer heat waves, worsening 
the effects of urban heat islands and increasing the risks of heat illness and deaths.3  
Urban greening refers to strategies that increase trees, parks, gardens, agriculture, forests, and other green and 
natural space in urban areas, and green infrastructure uses vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage 
and create healthier urban environments. Urban greening and green infrastructure can increase resilience to 
extreme heat and natural disasters while reducing other impacts of climate change, such as ﬂooding, storm 
surges, and sea level rise.4   
Green Infrastructure and Gray Infrastructure
Gray Infrastructure
Gray infrastructure refers to man-made structures such as storm sewers, levees, seawalls and detention ponds 
designed to move water or protect developed areas from ﬂooding.5 These structures—often made of concrete—
may increase water runoff, as surface water is unable to be ﬁltered through soil.6 Increased runoff contributes 
to ﬂooding during extreme rain events, and can increase the concentration of pollutants in runoff.7 Gray 
infrastructure retains heat from the air, contributing to the urban heat island effect and increasing nighttime air 
temperatures (Figure 5.4.1).8  
• 
The health risks of heat, air pollution and ﬂooding are increasing as climate change brings 
warmer temperatures, more extreme weather events and sea level rise. 
• 
These risks are greatest in “urban heat islands” and in places with aging infrastructure or where 
natural protections have been weakened. 
• 
Urban greening reduces the risk of heat illness and ﬂooding, lowers energy costs and improves 
health. 
• 
Green spaces provide places to be physically active and improve our overall well-being. 
• 
Trees sequester carbon dioxide, improve air quality, capture rainwater and replenish 
groundwater.
Key Messages

THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
Green Infrastructure
Green infrastructure includes: tree planting, rain barrels and rain gardens, green street design with permeable 
pavements and bioswales (sections or sidewalks or curbs with vegetation that allow natural treatment of runoff 
water), ecosystem restoration and green roofs.9,10,11 Green infrastructure:
• 
Provide more green and cool space, and reduce the risk of ﬂooding. 
• 
Increase resilience to extreme heat and natural disasters while reducing other impacts of climate change, 
such as ﬂooding, storm surges, and sea level rise
• 
 Reduce sewer overﬂows during storms, recharge groundwater aquifers water by allowing rainwater to 
soak into the ground, and reduce the energy needed to treat and move wastewater.12,13,14     
Figure 5.4.1: Green Infrastructure Rain Garden15 (left) and Grey Infrastructure16 (right) 
   
Urban Greening, Green Infrastructure, and Climate Change
Urban greening reduces urban heat islands and decreases the risk of heat illness by lowering surface and air 
temperatures.17,18,19      
• 
Shaded surfaces, from trees and other plants, may be 20–45°F cooler than unshaded surfaces;20 A 
vegetated “green roof” surface can be cooler than the surrounding air, whereas conventional rooftop 
surfaces can exceed ambient air temperatures by up to 90°F.21  
• 
Warm weather increases in energy demand for air conditioning, increasing the chance of electricity 
brown-outs.22 Shade cools buildings and can decrease air conditionings costs by 20%.23,24,25      
• 
Plants and vegetative growth can protect fragile coastal areas, mitigate sea level rise, and improve water 
quality and aquatic habitats.26 
• 
Trees sequester carbon dioxide (sequestering an estimated 95.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide  
in 2006).27

Urban Greening, Green Infrastructure, and Health
People living in urban heat islands are at greater risk of heat-related illness.28 Green infrastructure could reduce 
temperatures by 0.5–0.7°C.29 A 0.5°C reduction in the maximum and minimum temperatures results in a 50% 
reduction in heat-related mortality.30  
• 
Urban areas experience greater air pollution and more negative health impacts during hot summer 
months.31 Higher temperatures lead to higher levels of ozone, with increased risks for asthma and heart 
attacks.32 
• 
Trees clean the air by removing harmful pollutants associated with asthma and cardiovascular disease, 
such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter.33   
• 
Parks provide places for physical activity and social connection, and community gardens increase access 
to healthy foods (See Section 4.8—Food Security).34,35   
• 
Access to green space lowers stress, and even speeds up recovery times in hospitalized patients.37,38     
• 
Trees and greenery have been associated with reduction in crime and increases in property value.39 
Urban Greening, Green Infrastructure, and Health Equity
People of color and low-income families are more likely to live in areas with fewer trees, parks and green spaces 
and are thus more likely to be exposed to the heat risks of urban heat islands.40  
• 
People living in poverty are less able to afford the costs of air conditioning, making other heat adaptation 
strategies such as greening even more important.
• 
Accessible parks have been associated with greater physical activity, relaxation, social interaction, and 
improved quality of life in communities, especially in low-income communities and communities of 
color.41,42,43     
• 
Without intentional strategies to ensure equitable access to greening and green space for all, 
neighborhood greening may contribute to gentriﬁcation and displacement of lower-income residents.44 
101
THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF CLIMATE ACTION
What Can Local Health Departments Do
Public health professionals and health agencies have a critical role in building healthy, equitable, sustainable, and 
climate resilient communities. 
Assessment and Surveillance
See Section 7.1—Surveillance
Collaborate with parks and public works agencies and community-based organizations to map park access and to 
use tools such as i-Tree to assess tree canopy and the beneﬁts of planting more trees. (See Figure 5.4.2)45,46    
Figure 5.4.2: Map of Park Access for Children of Color Living in Poverty in Orange County47 
Conduct an assessment of the relationship between access to parks and health. 
• 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health assessed park access per capita in relation to 
premature mortality from various health outcomes. Areas with less park space had higher rates of 
premature mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, higher prevalence of childhood obesity, and 
greater economic hardship compared to communities with more park space per capita. African Americans 
and Latinos were also more likely than Asians and Whites to live in communities with less park access.48 
See the CDC’s Parks and Trails Health Impact Assessment Toolkit.49 
102
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Intersectoral Collaboration
See Section 7.3—Collaboration 
Collaborate with planning, parks, transportation, public works agencies and school districts to promote local 
policies that: 
• 
Increase parks and tree canopy especially in tree-poor and park-poor low-income communities. Consider 
tree ﬁre resistance, pollen production, and drought resistance. 
• 
Use trees to provide shade for school yards, parking lots, parks, and walking and bike paths 
• 
Restore and surface urban streams and rivers.50  
Collaborate with parks, school districts, police, and community partners to improve programming in parks—
especially those located in neighborhoods with high levels of violence or social isolation.51   
• 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health documented signiﬁcant beneﬁts following 
implementation of the Parks After Dark program, including increased physical activity, improved social 
cohesion, and decreased violent crime.52  
Work with public works to promote and develop “green streets”, particularly in tandem with development of 
Complete Streets that promote walking and biking.53  
• 
The Miami-Dade Health Department collaborated with the local Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces 
Department to create an Open Space Master Plan that builds a connected and equitable system of open 
spaces that encourage exercise, such as parks, natural areas, and cultural amenities linked by greenways, 
blueways, bike paths, and trails.54 
Collaborate with local health care providers and parks agencies to start a “Parks Prescription” program.55,56 
The D.C. Department of Health and the D.C. Parks and Recreation Department provided neighborhood-speciﬁc 
resources on park access to primary care physicians for distribution to patients.57 
Encourage community colleges and job training agencies to create apprenticeship programs that teach skills used 
to restore and create urban green spaces in low-income communities.58 
Community Engagement and Education
See Section 7.2—Engagement
• 
Educate communities on the health and climate beneﬁts of local parks and green space and provide 
clients with resources regarding local parks and related activities and events. 
• 
Engage residents in mapping park access and tree canopy, and support community initiatives to expand 
access to trees, parks, and green space.
• 
Survey community members to assess their experience of local parks to understand their needs and how 
local park use could be improved.59 
• 
Inform the public and local decision makers about the connections among green space, climate change, 
health, and equity.

5.5 Unintended Harms of Climate Action
Some climate mitigation and adaptation strategies have potentially adverse consequences on health and/or health 
equity. For example:
• 
Market mechanisms such as cap and trade or carbon taxes can, if poorly designed, lead to adverse 
impacts on low-income communities and communities of color, such as perpetuation of exposure of 
fence-line communities to stationary air pollution sources.1,2    
• 
Large scale production of ﬁrst-generation biofuels (e.g. corn ethanol) led to increases in the price of corn 
went up and in land use for commodity crops versus subsistence farming and other agriculture.3 
• 
Groundwater withdrawal may increase signiﬁcantly in response to drought, with consequences that may 
further limit water options in a prolonged drought, including:
 
increased concentration of drinking water contaminants.4  
 
saline intrusion into coastal aquifers, increasing treatment costs and limiting usable water reserves.5 
 
land subsidence, associated with signiﬁcant damage in parts of California, Texas and Florida in 
recent decades.6 
• 
Gentriﬁcation: as neighborhood amenities such as trees, parks, and bike-pedestrian infrastructure are 
enhanced, home values and rental prices increase, leading to the displacement of people of color and 
low-income families who may have been in the neighborhood for years.7 
• 
Encouraging walking and biking without concomitant enforcement of trafﬁc safety laws and street design 
protections, can inadvertently place pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk of injury and death.8  
• 
Prioritization of clean car strategies to the exclusion of efforts to reduce vehicle miles traveled fails to 
optimize health and climate beneﬁts.9 Clean cars provide critically important reductions in GHGE and air 
pollution, but do little to address the adverse impacts of motor vehicle use on physical activity, injuries, 
and unsustainable land use.
• 
Air conditioning is energy and cost intensive, increases street level heat, and with widespread use can 
cause brownouts.10
