 In a new study at NYU Langone Medical Center, we showed for the first time that air pollution is associated with narrowing of one of the large arteries in your neck and important cause of stroke. We looked at air quality monitors by zip code in the tri-state area and that gave us a sense of long-term air pollution exposure in specific regions and we then looked to see of that air pollution exposure, what sort of association there was with vascular disease and this is typical sources of air pollution from automobiles, from other sorts of power generation but if you are someone you have an elderly grandparent or an elderly parent who's had heart disease or had strokes it may be wise to avoid exposure outdoor time on days when the air quality is very bad. With our collaborators in environmental medicine at NYU Langone we're also looking at whether there are specific people based on their medical history or their genetic risk that may be more susceptible to the effects of environmental exposures.
