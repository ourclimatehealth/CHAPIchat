These strategies are complementary and intended to work in combination to reinforce each other. 
Similarly, commitment, collaboration, and leadership from numerous sectors, including public health, 
health care, education, social services, and non-governmental organizations, can maximize the impact 
of this technical package.  
Additional details on these strategies and approaches are available in the Appendix, along with 
summaries of supporting evidence and relevant sectors well positioned to lead implementation efforts. 
What Is a Technical Package? 
A technical package is a compilation of a core set of strategies to achieve and sustain substantial 
reductions in a specific risk factor or outcome.6 Technical packages help communities, organizations, 
and states prioritize prevention activities based on the best available evidence.  
This technical package has three components. 
1) The strategies are the actions to achieve the goal of improved asthma control.
2) The approaches are specific ways (e.g., programs, policies, or practices) to advance each
strategy.
3) The evidence is the scientific basis for each strategy or approach.
This technical package is a resource to guide and inform decision-making in communities, 
organizations, and states. This technical package is not a guideline or recommendation.

Controlling Asthma is a Priority 
Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs.7 It can cause wheezing, trouble breathing, chest tightness, 
and coughing.7 These symptoms increase during asthma attacks. Asthma attacks can require life-saving 
treatment in an emergency department (ED) or hospital.7 
 
Asthma is common and costly.  
• More than 24 million Americans have asthma, affecting 1 in 12 children and 1 in 14 adults.1  
• Each year, asthma accounts for more than 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.6 million emergency 
department (ED) visits, and 10.5 million physician office visits.1  
• About 10 people die of asthma each day.1  
• Asthma has been linked to 13.8 million missed school days and 14.2 million missed work days 
annually.3,4  
• The estimated cost of treating asthma in the United States is $62.8 billion every year.5 
 
The burden of asthma is unequally distributed.  
• People disproportionately affected by asthma include Black Americans, Puerto Ricans, and 
those with low income.1  
• Black Americans are approximately 2 times more likely to die from asthma than white 
Americans.8 
 
Asthma burden can be reduced by controlling asthma.  
• In the United States, 50% of adults with asthma and 40% of children with asthma do not have 
control of this disease.2  
• By taking appropriate medicine and avoiding triggers that can cause asthma attacks, asthma 
can be controlled and many asthma attacks can be prevented.7  
 
More About Asthma Control 
 
According to national guidelines7, controlling asthma consists of: 
1. Reducing impairment, which includes preventing asthma symptoms, reducing rescue 
medication use, maintaining lung function, and maintaining normal physical activity levels and 
attendance at work or school 
2. Reducing risk, which includes minimizing the need for ED visits and hospitalizations and 
preventing repeated asthma attacks 
 
In other words, controlling asthma: 
• Prevents symptoms like wheezing or coughing 
• Prevents ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma 
• Prevents missed work or school because of asthma 
• Helps people take part in all physical activities 
 
 
 
11 
 
Assessing the Evidence  
 
Assessing the evidence for this technical package included identifying impact on asthma control and 
characterizing the strength of evidence.  
• Evidence included in this technical package had to show a beneficial impact on asthma control. 
• Priority was given to meta-analyses or systematic reviews, followed by randomized controlled 
trials, and then quasi-experimental designs. If these study designs were unavailable because of 
feasibility or ethics, pre–post comparisons were acceptable (e.g., interventions implemented by 
a state or health insurance plan).  
• Impact on asthma control and strength of evidence are summarized in the text descriptions of 
the strategies, as well as in the Appendix. 
• In addition, priority was given to evidence from the United States. Regarding evidence from 
another country, consideration was given to the feasibility of implementation in a U.S. context. 
 
The examples provided in this technical package are not a comprehensive list of evidence-based 
programs, practices, or policies for each approach.  
• These are examples of success in improving asthma control.  
• Not all programs, practices, or policies that implement the same approach (e.g., home visits) 
are successful or equally effective; even those that are effective might not work across all 
populations.9  
 
In practice, the effectiveness of the programs, practices, and policies identified in this package will 
vary.  
• Factors affecting these programs, practices, and policies include the quality of their 
implementation and the communities in which they are implemented.  
• Tailoring and evaluating programs could improve understanding of program effectiveness 
across different communities.  
 
This technical package is ready for implementation now.  
• This technical package reflects the mature evidence base about how to control asthma. 
• Progress will continue to be made into the future.  
• As new programs, policies, or practices are identified, evaluated, and shown to be effective, this 
technical package can be updated and refined.  
• Implementation guidance has been or will be developed separately. Examples of existing 
implementation resources are described or referenced in the text description of each strategy.

Contextual and Cross-Cutting Themes 
 
An integrated approach to controlling asthma can achieve the greatest public health impact.  
• Research indicates multifaceted interventions to control asthma are generally more effective 
than individual strategies in isolation.7  
• The strategies in this technical package work in combination and reinforce each other to control 
asthma.  
• Extensive, long-lasting improvements in asthma control are best achieved by a focus across 
individuals, families, communities, health care providers, and societal-levels and across all 
sectors, private and public.7  
 
The social and cultural context of individuals and their communities is a critical consideration when 
implementing EXHALE.  
• The example programs, practices, and policies provided in this technical package have been 
implemented within particular contexts.  
• Practitioners in the field might be in the best position to assess needs and existing resources in 
their communities and to work with partners to implement EXHALE successfully. 
 
Engagement is important for the successful implementation of this technical package.  
• Engagement of people with asthma, their families, communities, and health care providers, 
among others, is vital to effective implementation of EXHALE. Thus, addressing barriers to 
engagement is valuable.10,11  
• Engagement and investment from multiple sectors are important for successful implementation 
of EXHALE. Public health agencies are well positioned to lead implementation efforts for 
selected EXHALE strategies and can serve as important collaborators for other EXHALE 
strategies. Leadership and commitment from other sectors (e.g., health care) are critical to 
implement strategies such as Achievement of Guidelines-Based Medical Management.  
• The role of various sectors in implementing EXHALE is described further in the section on Sector 
Involvement (page 31).  
 
The sections that follow describe the strategies and approaches with the best available evidence for 
improving asthma control. 
 
Examples of Barriers to Engagement 
 
• Among people with asthma, barriers to engagement include social determinants of health. 
These can affect availability of resources (e.g., time, money) to prioritize preventive behaviors 
to control their or their children’s asthma.12,13 Relatedly, household chaos (overall physical, 
social, and environmental disorder in the household), has been linked to less patient 
engagement and control of chronic disease.14-18  
 
• Among health care providers, engagement can be influenced by productivity expectations and 
burnout, which in turn can affect quality of care.11  
13 
 
Education on Asthma Self-Management     
 
Rationale for this Strategy 
• Asthma self-management education (AS-ME) is an important strategy for controlling asthma, 
according to national guidelines.7  
• Key educational messages of AS-ME include basic facts about asthma, roles of 
medications, how to use asthma medications correctly, what to do when asthma symptoms 
worsen, and how to reduce exposures to asthma triggers (i.e., environmental allergens and 
irritants). 7 
• Local, state, and federal factors (e.g., availability of AS-ME providers or provider reimbursement 
mechanisms) can limit access to and delivery of AS-ME.9,19-21  
• Improving access to and delivery of AS-ME can improve asthma control and reduce health care 
costs.7,9 
 
Approach for this Strategy 
 
Expanding access to and delivery of asthma self-management education  
• Effective AS-ME can be delivered in a variety of settings (e.g., individual, family, or group 
education in a clinic, school, pharmacy, or community) by a variety of providers (e.g., nurses, 
respiratory therapists, certified asthma educators, or community health workers).7,9,22  
• National standards exist for providing AS-ME and training asthma educators.19,23   
• AS-ME requires repetition and reinforcement.7 
• 
Proven models and potential pathways for sustainable delivery of AS-ME are discussed at 
http://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/asthma and in other public resources.9,24,25  
 
Evidence for this Strategy 
 
Expanding access to and delivery of asthma self-management education  
• Many studies have shown that AS-ME can improve asthma control and medication adherence 
while reducing ED visits, hospitalizations, and missed work or school days.7,9,22,26   
• Over 25 U.S. programs have shown that AS-ME often can reduce health care costs within 1 to 3 
years, by preventing asthma-related ED visits, hospitalizations, or urgent care visits9, including:  
 Adult and pediatric patients of community health centers (i.e., federally qualified health 
centers) who received 5 AS-ME lessons experienced fewer ED and urgent care 
visits.9,27,28 Their health insurance plan observed cost savings of 22% for adult patients 
and 39% for pediatric patients.9,27,28 
 When school nurses at 61 schools received training and supplies to provide AS-ME to 
their students, participating students experienced better asthma control and saved 
Medicaid an average of $1,431 per student over 1 year.29 
• U.S. health insurance plans have engaged in approximately 20 AS-ME programs reporting 
return on investment or other cost savings data, including at least 15 home-based AS-ME 
programs and 4 programs providing AS-ME in other settings such as clinic.9,30,31 Additional 
14 
 
information on home visits is available in the section Home Visits for Trigger Reduction and 
Asthma Self-Management Education (page 17). 
 
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approach are available in the Appendix. 
 
What Is a Certified Asthma Educator?  
• A certified asthma educator typically is a licensed health care professional (e.g., nurse, 
respiratory therapist) with an additional certification in asthma education, but non-health care 
professionals also can become certified if they have at least 1,000 hours of relevant experience 
and pass the National Asthma Educator Certification Board Exam.23 
• Multiple effective, economically sustainable programs implementing EXHALE strategies (e.g., 
AS-ME, home visits for trigger reduction and AS-ME) have involved certified asthma 
educators.9,32-34 
• Additional information regarding certified asthma educators is available online.23 
 
What Is a Community Health Worker?  
• A community health worker is a frontline public health worker who is a trusted community 
member or has a deep cultural understanding of the community served. This person serves as a 
liaison between health and social services and the community to facilitate access to services 
and to improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery.  
• Multiple effective, economically sustainable programs implementing EXHALE strategies (e.g., 
AS-ME, home visits for trigger reduction and AS-ME, coordination of care) have involved 
community health workers.9,33,35,36 
• Additional information regarding community health workers, including asthma-specific training 
tools, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/stltpublichealth/chw and in other public resources.37-
42 
 
 
 
 
15 
 
X-tinguishing Smoking and Secondhand Smoke 
 
Rationale for this Strategy 
• Tobacco smoke is a known trigger of asthma attacks.7,43 National asthma guidelines 
recommend people with asthma avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.7  
• About 1 in 5 of U.S. adults with asthma smoke cigarettes and about 9% of adult asthma-related 
ED visits are related to smoking.44,45  
• Approximately half of children with asthma (54%) are exposed to secondhand smoke in the 
home; this exposure is linked to a 63% increase in asthma-related ED visits among low-income, 
urban children.46,47  
• Secondhand smoke exposure before birth is a risk factor for childhood asthma and wheezing.48-
52 Thus, national asthma guidelines recommend pregnant women avoid both smoking and 
exposure to secondhand smoke.7 
• Interventions to reduce smoking and secondhand smoke exposure can improve asthma control 
and reduce health care costs.7,43,53-56 
 
Approaches for this Strategy 
 
Reducing tobacco smoking 
• National guidelines for reducing tobacco smoking recommend interventions such as cessation 
counseling (individual, group, or telephone-based) and cessation medications approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).57-63  
• Proven approaches include focused tobacco cessation interventions as well as those provided in 
combination with other asthma-related interventions (e.g., self-management education).58-60,64 
Additional information on reducing tobacco smoking is available in national tobacco cessation 
guidelines57 and at http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco.   
 
Reducing exposure to secondhand smoke 
• Providing tobacco cessation counseling or FDA-approved cessation medications to parents or 
caregivers of children with asthma is effective, especially when combined with other asthma-
related interventions (e.g., self-management education).65-73  
• Many successful programs have delivered these interventions through home visits.65-73 
Additional information on home visits is available in the section Home Visits for Trigger 
Reduction and Asthma Self-Management Education (page 17). 
• Proven interventions to reduce smoking among pregnant women could reduce secondhand 
smoke exposure before birth, a recommendation of national asthma guidelines.7,62,74-76  
• Smokefree policies are effective in reducing exposure to secondhand smoke and improving 
asthma control. Additional information is available in the section Environmental Policies or Best 
Practices to Reduce Asthma Triggers from Indoor, Outdoor, and Occupational Sources (page 
26).77  
 
 
16 
 
Evidence for this Strategy 
 
Reducing tobacco smoking 
• Research shows that tobacco cessation can improve asthma control and lung function while 
reducing rescue medication use, ED visits, and urgent office visits.58-60,78 Significant 
improvements in lung function have been observed as early as 24 hours after quitting 
smoking.79 
• For example, a controlled study that provided nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum or 
oral inhaler) to adults with asthma found significant improvements in asthma symptoms, 
quality of life, rescue medication use, and lung function. Individuals who quit smoking also 
needed 25% less inhaled steroid medication to control their asthma.58 
 
Reducing exposure to secondhand smoke 
• Research shows that providing tobacco cessation treatments to parents or caregivers of 
children with asthma can reduce ED visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days; these 
treatments can also reduce health care costs.65-69,71,80 These studies include multiple 
randomized controlled trials66-69,71 and also include populations with high asthma burden (e.g., 
Medicaid-eligible, African American, or Puerto Rican).65-69,71,80 
• 
For example, a program providing 3 home visits for tobacco cessation counseling and asthma 
self-management education to Medicaid-enrolled parents or caregivers of children with asthma 
significantly reduced asthma-related ED visits, hospitalizations, and office visits among these 
children, as well as associated health care costs.69 
 
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approaches are available in the Appendix. 
 
 
17 
 
Home Visits for Trigger Reduction and Asthma Self-
Management Education 
 
Rationale for this Strategy 
• Home visits to reduce environmental asthma triggers and provide asthma self-management 
education (AS-ME) can improve asthma control (e.g., when asthma is not controlled despite 
guidelines-based medical management and AS-ME outside the home).7,9,81,82 
• Home visits can reveal barriers to patient engagement, adherence, or asthma control not 
previously recognized or fully appreciable in the outpatient, ED, or hospital setting (e.g., 
housing conditions, social stressors, work and family obligations that affect individuals’ or 
families’ abilities to manage asthma).83 
• Home visit programs for asthma remain limited. Local, state, and federal factors play a role 
(e.g., availability of home visit programs, infrastructure to pay for home visit services or 
providers).7,9,10,81,82,84  
• Improving access to and delivery of home visits for selected people with asthma can improve 
asthma control and reduce health care costs.7,9,81,82  
 
Approach for this Strategy 
 
Expanding access to and delivery of home visits (as needed) for asthma trigger reduction and AS-ME  
• 
Home visits might be necessary to improve asthma control among some individuals with 
asthma (e.g., those whose asthma is not controlled despite guidelines-based medical 
management and AS-ME outside the home).7,9,81,82 
• 
These home visit programs can serve as care management programs for people at high risk for 
asthma attacks.85  
• 
Effective home visit programs provide both multifaceted asthma trigger reduction and AS-
ME.7,9,81,82 
• 
A variety of providers can effectively deliver home visits for asthma, including nurses, 
respiratory therapists, certified asthma educators, and trained community health 
workers.7,9,81,82 
• To reduce asthma triggers in the home (e.g., cockroaches, dust mites, mold, secondhand 
smoke), successful programs have provided, at a minimum, education on how individuals or 
families can decrease their exposure to asthma triggers.7,9,81,82 Some programs help participants 
even further, e.g., through integrated pest management, providing supplies (e.g., bedding 
encasements, cleaning supplies), or communicating with health care providers, schools, or 
social services. The importance of these linkages is further described in the section Linkages 
and Coordination of Care Across Settings (page 23).9  
• 
Relevant implementation guidance is available in CDC’s Strategies for Addressing Asthma in 
Homes86 and other public resources.40,87,88 Proven models and potential pathways for 
sustainable delivery of home visit programs for asthma are discussed at 
http://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/asthma and elsewhere online.9,24,87,89 
18 
•
Addressing barriers that prevent people with asthma from participating in home visit programs
(e.g., trust or scheduling concerns) could improve program efficiency.10,13
Evidence for this Strategy 
Expanding access to and delivery of home visits (as needed) for asthma trigger reduction and AS-ME 
•
Many studies, including a systematic review and multiple randomized controlled trials, have
shown that home visits can improve asthma control and medication adherence while reducing
ED visits, hospitalizations, and missed work or school days.7,9,35,81,82,90-95
•
Over 40 U.S. programs have shown that home visits can reduce health care costs.9,96 Among
these programs, the median estimated time to achieve return on investment was 3 years.9
•
For example, a randomized controlled trial found that a program offering Medicaid-enrolled
children up to 4 home visits by a community health worker for trigger reduction and AS-ME
(over a 4 month period) significantly reduced urgent asthma-related health care utilization (e.g.,
ED visits, hospitalizations) and achieved a return on investment of $1.90 per $1 spent within 2
years.35
•
U.S. health insurance plans have engaged in at least 15 asthma-related home visit programs
reporting return on investment or other cost savings data.9,30,31
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approach are available in the Appendix. 
Selected State Success Stories 
Michigan: Managing Asthma Through Case-management in Homes (MATCH) Programs 
•
Nurses or respiratory therapists (all certified asthma educators) providing home visits for case
management, AS-ME, and trigger reduction have reduced ED visits and hospitalizations by
~60%, while also reducing missed school and work days.9,32,97
•
Multiple Medicaid health insurance plans have reimbursed providers for these services.
•
These services have been replicated across the state.
•
Return on investment is an estimated as $2.10 per $1 spent.9,32,34,97
Montana: Montana Asthma Home Visiting Program (MAP) 
•
Nurses providing home visits for trigger reduction and AS-ME have reduced asthma symptoms,
ED visits, and missed school and work days.97,98
•
This program also has improved asthma control, inhaler technique, and self-management
among participants.95,97
Rhode Island: Home Asthma Response Program (HARP) 
•
Certified asthma educators and community health workers teamed up to provide home visits
for AS-ME and trigger reduction (including environmental supplies); these home visits reduced
ED and hospital costs by 76%, an average of $1,606 per program participant over the following
year. Overall return on investment was $1.33 per $1 spent.33
•
Even greater cost savings were seen among the subset of ‘high utilizers’ (participants with at
least 2 asthma-related ED visits or 1 hospitalization prior to program enrollment). For high
19 
utilizers, ED and hospital costs decreased 80%, an average of $2,708 per person over the 
following year. Among high utilizers, return on investment was $2.26 per $1 spent.33 
•
Quality indicators also improved, with asthma medication ratio HEDIS scores increasing from
32% to 46%, use of asthma action plans rising from 20% to 80%, and participants with well-
controlled asthma growing from 20% to 52%.33

Achievement of Guidelines-Based Medical Management 
 
Rationale for this Strategy 
• Evidence-based recommendations for medical management of asthma are provided in national 
asthma guidelines (i.e., Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of 
Asthma [EPR-3] from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program).7 
• However, guidelines-based medical management of asthma is not routine, leading to 
inadequate asthma control.99-102  
• Increased use of guidelines-based medical management can improve asthma control and 
reduce health care costs.101-106 
• Evidence-based opportunities to increase use of guidelines-based medical management of 
asthma among populations include strengthening system supports and improving access and 
adherence to asthma medications and devices (e.g., spacers).26,101-110 
 
Approaches for this Strategy 
 
Strengthening systems supporting guidelines-based medical care, including appropriate prescribing 
and use of inhaled corticosteroids 
• Effective interventions providing clinical support or feedback include: 
 Focused training of health care providers including physicians, nurses, and 
pharmacists.99,104,105,111 
 Audit and feedback systems implemented by health care organizations or health 
insurance plans, which analyze medical records to identify patients who could benefit 
from asthma control interventions.99,104,112,113 
 Decision support tools (electronic or paper-based) designed to promote guidelines-
based medical management (e.g., pocket-sized guidelines summaries, system 
reminders, treatment algorithms).99,114 
• Other interventions shown to support access to or delivery of guidelines-based medical care 
include: 
 School-based health centers, which provide primary health care on-campus or off-site. 
More information about school-based health centers is available online.115-119 
 Coordinated care for people with asthma. Additional information on coordinated care is 
available in the section Linkages and Coordination of Care Across Settings (page 23). 
• Quality improvement projects and initiatives are examples of ways to implement these types of 
interventions.99,106 
• Relevant implementation guidance is available in several publications produced by the National 
Asthma Education and Prevention Program, which is coordinated by the National Institutes of 
Health.100,120  
 
Improving access and adherence to asthma medications and devices 
• Copayment amounts for asthma medications and devices can influence whether people with 
asthma obtain prescribed treatments.108-110 
 
21 
 
• A proven method of improving adherence is shared treatment decision-making, in which 
patients with asthma and their health care providers collaborate to decide on treatment.26,107 
This process provides opportunities to discuss patient goals, preferences, or concerns.26,107 
 
Evidence for this Strategy 
 
Strengthening systems supporting guidelines-based medical care, including appropriate prescribing 
and use of inhaled corticosteroids 
• Many studies, including a systematic review and multiple randomized controlled trials, have 
shown interventions providing asthma-related clinical support or feedback to health care 
providers can improve patients’ asthma symptoms and controller medication use while 
reducing ED visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days.10,94,99,104-106,114,121 
• For example, a large randomized controlled trial found that a 2-session interactive training for 
primary care physicians led to a 45% decrease in asthma-related ED visits and a 46% decrease in 
days limited by asthma symptoms among patients of physicians who received this training (the 
Physician Asthma Care Education curriculum).105,121  
• Audit and feedback systems (e.g., using claims data) also can reduce asthma-related ED visits by 
up to 55% and hospitalizations by up to 56%. Return on investment for these systems is an 
estimated $2 to $4 per $1 spent.10,103,104,106 
• A systematic review found fewer asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations occurred among 
students of schools with school-based health centers, compared to schools without school-
based health centers. 115-119 
 
Improving access and adherence to asthma medications and devices 
• Studies have linked access to prescribed asthma treatments to improved asthma control, 
increased controller medication use, reduced rescue medication use, fewer ED visits and 
hospitalizations, and lower health care costs.26,107-110,122,123 
• Effects of out-of-pocket medication costs on medication adherence and health outcomes have 
been studied in over 51,000 people with asthma.108-110 Two of these studies showed that higher 
copayment costs affected whether people obtained prescribed asthma treatments.109,110 An 
additional study demonstrated that higher out-of-pocket costs for asthma medications were 
associated with less medication use and more asthma-related hospitalizations.108 
• Shared treatment decision-making between people with poorly controlled asthma and their 
health care providers led to improved asthma control, fewer asthma-related medical visits, 
decreased rescue medication use, and better lung function, in a large randomized controlled 
trial of more than 600 participants.107

State Success Story 
 
Missouri: Drug Utilization Review of Medicaid Pharmacy Claims Data 
• This quality improvement intervention analyzed Medicaid pharmacy claims data to identify 
people with asthma whose medication use did not follow guidelines-based medical 
management; these individuals’ health care providers were then notified by mail.124 
• In one year, this audit and feedback system improved controller medication adherence, 
decreased overutilization of rescue inhalers, and resulted in Medicaid savings on pharmacy 
costs.124 
• Medicaid savings on asthma-related medications were $5.92 per patient per month (compared 
to a control group), leading to a total estimated savings of more than $430,000 for the 6-month 
post-intervention period.124 
23 
 
Linkages and Coordination of Care Across Settings 
 
Rationale for this Strategy 
• Coordinated care includes promoting linkages within and across the health care system and 
community services to address patients’ needs (e.g., medical, social) and improve 
health.10,125,126 
• Improved coordination of care could reduce total U.S. health care expenditures by $240 to 
$310 billion annually.127 
• Improving access to coordinated care for people with asthma can improve asthma control and 
reduce health care costs.9,36,128-138 
 
Approach for this Strategy 
Promoting coordinated care for people with asthma 
• Health care provider organizations, health insurance plans, schools, and community 
organizations can emphasize coordinated care through interventions such as patient-centered 
medical homes, disease management, case management, and school- or community-based 
programs.9,36,128-138 
• A variety of providers can successfully coordinate care and facilitate linkages across settings, 
including nurses, community health workers, social workers, and case managers.9,10,36,128-138 
• Successful coordination of care can: 
 Be facilitated by partnerships and health information exchange (e.g., using health 
information technology) between organizations or sectors such as health care, 
education, and non-governmental organizations.10,113,129-131,139-141 
 Involve or support other strategies in this technical package (e.g., AS-ME, home visits for 
trigger reduction and AS-ME, achievement of guidelines-based medical 
management)9,36,128-133; these strategies are described further in their respective 
sections of this document. 
• Relevant implementation guidance is available at http://pcmh.ahrq.gov, 
http://bphc.hrsa.gov/qualityimprovement/clinicalquality/accreditation-pcmh/selection.html, 
and in other public resources.142,143 
 
What Is a Patient-Centered Medical Home?  
 
A patient-centered medical home, also known as a primary care medical home, is a model of health 
care that puts patients at the forefront of care.125,142 Its priorities include: 
• Coordinated, team-based, patient-centered care 
• Linkages among care providers 
• Health care quality  
 
Studies have shown this model can improve health care quality, patient experiences and staff 
satisfaction while reducing health care costs.142 
 
24 
 
Evidence for this Strategy 
 
Promoting coordinated care for people with asthma 
• Many studies, including several randomized controlled trials, have shown that coordinated care 
can improve asthma control and controller medication use while reducing ED visits, 
hospitalizations, and missed school and work days.9,36,94,128-136,144 
• Multiple programs have shown that coordinated asthma care can reduce health care 
costs.133,134,138 Return on investment has been reported as $1.33 per $1 spent within 3 years.133 
• A wide variety of providers and organizations have improved asthma control by expanding 
access to coordinated care for people with asthma, including: 
 Numerous health insurance plans across the country have improved asthma control 
and reduced health care costs by coordinating asthma care using trained staff members 
(e.g., case managers or community health workers) or contracts with community 
organizations to provide these services, often through home visits.9,10 Additional 
information on home visits is available in the section Home Visits for Trigger Reduction 
and Asthma Self-Management Education (page 17). 
 A state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, supported by state and federal 
funding, implemented patient-centered medical homes in 92 pediatric practices and 
improved asthma control within 100 days, including an 18% reduction in missed school 
days and a 21% reduction in ED visits and acute care visits.128 
 A hospital-run, community-based program emphasizing coordinated asthma care 
through services including nurse case management, linkage to primary care providers, 
and home visits for trigger reduction and AS-ME reduced ED visits by 68% and 
hospitalizations by 85%,132 Return on investment was $1.33 per $1 spent within 3 
years.133 
 School-based programs providing coordinated asthma care (including increased 
communication between schools and primary care providers) through school nurses or 
other staff have improved asthma control and reduced ED visits, urgent care visits, and 
missed school days.130,131 These successful programs have also provided AS-ME to 
children or families.130,131 Additional information on school-based strategies to address 
asthma is available in CDC’s Strategies for Addressing Asthma in Schools.145 
 
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approach are available in the Appendix.

State Success Story 
 
Indiana: Parkview Health’s Emergency Department Asthma Call Back Program 
• A registered nurse or registered respiratory therapist contacts (via phone or email) people with 
asthma who visit Parkview Health’s emergency department (ED) within 7–14 days of the 
visit.146,147 These staff provide various services, including discussing the status of asthma 
control, assessing whether people can afford prescribed asthma medications, offering home 
visits, linking people to primary care physicians and patient-centered medical homes, 
encouraging people to make and keep regular medical appointments, and providing AS-ME and 
mitigation resources as needed.146,147  
• This program has effectively reduced asthma-related ED visits and missed school and work 
days.146,147 
• Return on investment is >$1 per $1 spent.147,148 
• Collaboration between the local health care system, local school districts, and the local and 
state health department helped this program succeed.146,147,149,150

Environmental Policies or Best Practices to Reduce Asthma 
Triggers from Indoor, Outdoor, and Occupational Sources 
 
 
This section has three parts. 
Part 1: Indoor sources of asthma triggers 
Part 2: Outdoor sources of asthma triggers 
Part 3: Occupational sources of asthma triggers 
 
The approaches described in each part of this section represent the best available evidence to improve 
asthma control. As the evidence base grows for environmental policies or best practices to reduce 
asthma triggers, these approaches can be updated and refined. 
 
 
Part 1: Indoor Sources of Asthma Triggers 
 
Rationale for this Strategy (Part 1) 
• Overall, people spend 90% of their time indoors and much of this time is spent in the home.151 
• Indoor sources of asthma triggers include mold, secondhand smoke, dust mites, rodents, 
cockroaches, and furry household pets.152 
• Interventions to reduce indoor sources of asthma triggers can improve asthma control and be 
cost-saving.153-163 
 
Approaches for this Strategy (Part 1) 
 
Facilitating home energy efficiency, including home weatherization assistance programs 
• Home improvement incentives (e.g., loans, grants, or tax credits) can help low-income families 
improve their homes’ energy efficiency and simultaneously reduce or remove health hazards 
such as mold, moisture, or pests.164,165 
• Examples exist of incentives implemented at the local, state, or federal level.165-171 
• Some home weatherization improvements that can reduce indoor sources of asthma triggers 
include improving insulation, ventilation, and moisture control.165,170 These changes can 
complement home visit programs for asthma.13,172 Additional information on home visits is 
available in the section Home Visits for Trigger Reduction and Asthma Self-Management 
Education (page 17). 
 
Facilitating smokefree policies 
27 
 
• Numerous U.S. communities, states, and other nations have implemented comprehensive 
smokefree policies, which prohibit smoking in all indoor spaces of workplaces, restaurants, and 
bars.153-160,173,174 
• Enforcement is easier and effectiveness of smokefree policies is greater when fewer policy 
exemptions exist (e.g., exemptions for designated smoking areas or certain types of restaurants 
or bars).175-177 
• Smokefree policies for residences (e.g., houses, apartments) can be voluntary or mandatory; 
individuals, families, or property owners (public or private) can implement these policies.178,179  
• Smokefree policies reduce tobacco smoking and reduce nonsmokers’ exposure to secondhand 
smoke. Additional information on tobacco use and secondhand smoke is available in the section 
X-tinguishing Smoking and Secondhand Smoke (page 15). 
 
Evidence for this Strategy (Part 1) 
 
Facilitating home energy efficiency, including home weatherization assistance programs 
• Studies have shown improving the homes of low-income individuals or families (e.g., through 
home weatherization assistance programs) can reduce asthma-related ED visits, health care 
costs, missed work, or missed school days.161-163  
• The cost of weatherizing an entire house can be comparable to the cost of one hospitalization 
for asthma.170,180  
• A study from the state of Washington observed asthma-related Medicaid costs decreased an 
average of $785 per person per year, among individuals participating in a weatherization 
assistance program to improve their homes.162   
 
Facilitating smokefree policies 
• Multiple U.S. studies, including a systematic review, have found that smokefree policies can 
reduce asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations.153-160,181 
• Besides improving asthma control153-160, smokefree policies have decreased hospitalizations for 
heart attacks, reduced health care costs, and lowered the cost of cleaning, repairing, or 
maintaining housing.181-184 
• Smokefree policies with fewer exemptions have been linked to larger reductions in 
hospitalizations for respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma), compared to smokefree policies with 
more exemptions.157 
• A systematic review of 179 studies showed that smokefree policies have not hurt the business 
activity of restaurants, bars, or companies catering to tourists.176,181,185 
 
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approaches are available in the Appendix. 
 
 
28 
 
Part 2: Outdoor Sources of Asthma Triggers 
 
Rationale for this Strategy (Part 2) 
• Strong evidence links outdoor air pollutants (e.g., from vehicle exhaust, factory emissions, or 
smoke) to increased asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations.186, 187, 188  
• Children with asthma can be especially vulnerable to negative health effects caused by air 
pollution.189,190  
• Interventions to reduce outdoor air pollution can improve asthma control and be cost-saving 
for communities.191,192 
 
Approach for this Strategy (Part 2) 
 
Facilitating clean diesel school buses 
• Adopting clean diesel technology for school buses involves retrofitting or modifying school 
buses with older diesel engines to run more cleanly (e.g., by using diesel oxidation catalysts, 
crankcase ventilation systems, or ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel).192 
• States or local jurisdictions have obtained clean diesel school buses using voluntary incentives 
(e.g., grants or rebates) or mandatory regulation.191-196 
• Decreased diesel emissions from using clean diesel school buses can complement existing 
policies to reduce school bus idling in multiple states.197-199  
 
Evidence for this Strategy (Part 2) 
 
Facilitating clean diesel school buses 
• U.S. school districts adopting clean diesel technology for some or all of their school buses have 
improved children’s lung function, decreased asthma- or bronchitis-related hospitalizations by 
23%, and reduced missed school days by 8%; some benefits can occur within one month of 
making these changes (e.g., missed school days).191,192 
• So far, switching to clean diesel school buses has prevented approximately 14 million missed 
school days in the United States.191 
• Return on investment is an estimated $7 to $16 per $1 spent on shifting to clean diesel school 
buses, because of savings from averted respiratory-related hospitalizations.192 
• Existing studies might underestimate the overall public health benefits of using clean diesel 
school buses, because other research has linked diesel emissions to other illnesses (e.g., 
pneumonia, heart disease, cancer).200-203 Over half of U.S. children (approximately 25 million) 
ride school buses to and from school.204 On average, these children spend nearly 45 minutes 
each day on the bus.191 
 
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approaches are available in the Appendix. 
29 
 
Part 3: Occupational Sources of Asthma Triggers 
 
Rationale for this Strategy (Part 3) 
• Workplace conditions can cause asthma (this is called “occupational asthma”). Approximately 1 
in 6 cases of adult-onset asthma are attributable to occupation.205 
• Workplace conditions also can worsen existing asthma (this is called “work-exacerbated 
asthma” or “work-aggravated asthma”). More than 1 in 5 adults with asthma experience this 
effect.206 
• The overall estimated cost of work-related asthma (i.e., the combination of occupational 
asthma and work-exacerbated asthma) is at least $1.6 billion annually.207 People with work-
related asthma experience more long-term disability, frequent health care use, loss of income, 
and unemployment compared to people with asthma that is not work-related.208-210 
• Interventions to eliminate or reduce workplace triggers of asthma can prevent occupational 
asthma, improve control of work-related asthma, and reduce health care costs.208,211-213 Asthma 
medications complement but do not replace interventions in the workplace environment.208 
 
Approaches for this Strategy (Part 3) 
 
Eliminating exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace whenever possible  
• Effective methods to eliminate workplace exposure to asthma triggers include engineering 
controls (e.g., in ventilation systems) or replacing workplace materials that can cause or trigger 
asthma with other materials without these effects.211,213 
• Another proven method is to change work responsibilities or jobs, but this option can result in 
unemployment or loss of income for the worker.208 
• Avoiding use of powdered allergen-rich natural rubber latex gloves is recommended by national 
and international experts on work-related asthma.213 
 
Reducing exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace (if eliminating exposures is not possible) 
• Reducing exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace (e.g., engineering controls such as 
ventilation, or administrative controls such as limiting the number of hours per week that 
workers are exposed to asthma triggers) is not the preferred approach based on current 
evidence, but a person’s income or employment might be less affected by reducing exposure 
instead of eliminating exposure.211,213 
• This approach requires careful medical monitoring to ensure that worsened asthma is detected 
quickly.208 
• According to national and international experts on work-related asthma, respiratory protective 
devices do not reduce exposure to asthma triggers effectively, especially in the long term and in 
patients with severe asthma.208,213 
 
 
 
30 
 
Evidence for this Strategy (Part 3) 
 
Eliminating exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace whenever possible 
• Multiple systematic reviews have shown that eliminating exposure to asthma triggers is the 
best preventive approach.211-213 Benefits include fewer asthma symptoms and improved lung 
function.211-213 
• Another systematic review found that for persons with occupational asthma (asthma caused by 
workplace conditions), completely avoiding the cause of their occupational asthma maximizes 
chances for improvement but does not guarantee full recovery.208 However, ongoing exposure 
would likely worsen asthma.208 
• The recommendation to avoid using powdered allergen-rich natural rubber latex gloves is 
based on a systematic review that found a high level of evidence for this intervention.213 
 
Reducing exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace (if eliminating exposures is not possible) 
• A systematic review showed that reducing exposure to workplace asthma triggers improves 
asthma symptoms but has not clearly improved lung function.211 
• Notably, this systematic review also found that reducing exposure to workplace asthma triggers 
did not improve asthma symptoms as much as eliminating or removing exposure to workplace 
asthma triggers.211 
• Multiple systematic reviews have concluded that based on currently available evidence, 
respiratory protective devices cannot be considered a safe way to reduce exposure to asthma 
triggers in the workplace, especially in the long term, in patients with severe asthma, and in 
patients with occupational asthma (asthma caused by workplace conditions).208,212,213 
 
Additional details on the evidence for this strategy and its approaches are available in the Appendix. 
 
 
31 
 
Sector Involvement                
 
Engagement and investment from multiple sectors are important for successful implementation of 
EXHALE. Collaboration across sectors can harness existing infrastructure and resources, reduce 
redundancy, and create synergy. Public health can be a leader in improving asthma control, but the 
public health sector cannot accomplish the strategies and approaches outlined in this technical 
package alone. 
 
Below are examples of how individuals or organizations from various sectors can consider 
supporting the implementation of this technical package. These examples are not a comprehensive 
description of opportunities available to various sectors, nor are they a complete list of sectors that can 
consider implementation activities related to this technical package. Other key sectors include (but are 
not limited to) social services, housing, employers, media, and non-governmental organizations (e.g., 
national or community organizations). 
 
Opportunities for federal, state, and local public health officials include:  
• Promoting or implementing this technical package. 
• Evaluating the impact of and progress in implementing this technical package.  
• Bringing together different sectors, partners, or stakeholders to plan, prioritize, and coordinate 
implementation of this technical package.  
• Continuing collecting and disseminating data on the burden of asthma. 
 
Opportunities for other federal, state, and local government officials include:  
• Establishing or supporting quality improvement initiatives or projects that implement one or 
more of the strategies in this technical package. 
• Considering eliminating Medicaid or Medicare coverage requirements that could restrict access 
to evidence-based treatments for asthma or tobacco cessation (e.g., quantity limits, prior 
authorization, copayments, or requiring patients to obtain asthma devices such as spacers from 
durable medical equipment vendors instead of pharmacies).  
• Allocating resources to improve access to AS-ME, smoking cessation, asthma-related home 
visits, and coordination of care. For example, states might consider “activating” Current 
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to pay for AS-ME or encourage their Medicaid managed 
care organizations to increase delivery of AS-ME and asthma-related home visits (e.g., through 
contractual agreements or quality-improvement projects). Relevant implementation guidance, 
including a list of relevant CPT codes, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/asthma. 
• Supporting workforce development for the delivery of AS-ME or home visits; relevant activities 
include building infrastructure for professional training, licensing, and reimbursement of 
certified asthma educators, community health workers, and other allied health professionals.  
Relevant implementation guidance is available at http://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/asthma and 
in other public resources.23,214-216 
• Promoting infrastructure for health information technology so that individuals are at the center 
of their care, health care providers have the ability to securely access and use health 
information from different sources, and asthma care quality can be measured and used to 
32 
 
provide feedback. Relevant implementation guidance is available at 
http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/interoperability.  
• Implementing or supporting policies and best practices proven to improve asthma control (e.g., 
home improvement incentives, smokefree policies, or clean diesel school buses). Additional 
information is available in the section Environmental Policies or Best Practices to Reduce 
Asthma Triggers from Indoor, Outdoor, and Occupational Sources (page 26). 
 
Opportunities for health care providers or organizations include: 
• Assessing asthma severity and regularly monitoring asthma control in patients. 
• Prescribing inhaled corticosteroids according to national asthma guidelines.7,100 
• Using tools such as shared treatment decision-making or AS-ME to improve adherence to 
asthma medication. Additional information on shared treatment decision-making and AS-ME is 
available in the sections Achievement of Guidelines-Based Medical Management (page 20) and 
Education on Asthma Self-Management (page 13), respectively. 
• Investigating and considering available payment mechanisms to support their or their staff’s 
delivery of asthma self-management education (e.g., CPT codes). A list of relevant CPT codes is 
available at http://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/asthma. 
• Referring patients to asthma-related home visit programs available through local health care 
systems, community organizations, or patients’ health insurance plans, especially when asthma 
is not controlled despite guidelines-based medical management and AS-ME outside the home. 
• Promoting coordination of care in their practices or health care organizations (e.g., through 
quality improvement projects or initiatives).125,142 
• Communicating and collaborating with local schools or health care organizations to share 
asthma treatment plans efficiently, effectively, and securely across places where individuals 
might seek help for their asthma. 
 
Opportunities for health insurance plans include: 
• Emphasizing national asthma guidelines7,100 in their clinical practice guidelines. 
• Using pharmacy, ED, and hospital claims data to identify and engage individuals or families who 
could benefit from AS-ME, smoking cessation, asthma-related home visits, improved 
coordination of care, or increased adherence to guidelines-based medical management of 
asthma. Additional information on each of these EXHALE strategies is available in their 
respective sections of this document. 
• Considering how their coverage requirements might affect access to evidence-based 
treatments for asthma or tobacco cessation. Potential barriers include quantity limits, prior 
authorization, copayments, or requiring patients to obtain asthma devices (e.g., spacers) from 
durable medical equipment vendors instead of pharmacies. 
• Providing AS-ME or asthma-related home visits to patients using trained in-house staff (e.g., 
certified asthma educators or trained community health workers) or by contracting with health 
care providers or community organizations to provide these services. Relevant implementation 
guidance is available at http://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/asthma and in other public 
resources.10,13 
 
 
 
33 
 
Opportunities for schools, school nurses, and school districts include: 
• Communicating and collaborating with local health care providers to share important asthma 
information about students (e.g., asthma action plans, level of asthma control) efficiently and 
effectively. These partnerships can be supported by the development of consent forms or 
policies to promote communication while protecting student and patient privacy. Additional 
relevant information is available in the section Linkages and Coordination of Care Across 
Settings (page 23). 
• Adopting clean diesel technology for school buses to reduce students’ exposure to diesel 
emissions, a known asthma trigger. Additional information is available in the section 
Environmental Policies or Best Practices to Reduce Asthma Triggers from Indoor, Outdoor, and 
Occupational Sources (page 26). 
• Supporting implementation of other EXHALE strategies such as Education on Asthma Self-
Management and Achievement of Guidelines-Based Medical Management. Additional 
information on these strategies is available in their respective sections. 
• Reviewing CDC’s Strategies for Addressing Asthma in Schools.145 
 
Opportunities for employers include: 
• Promoting healthy workplaces by eliminating or reducing known asthma triggers. 
• Considering or requesting insurance coverage of preventive asthma services such as AS-ME or 
home visits when purchasing health insurance for employees. 
• Reviewing resources that CDC offers employers to help employees stay healthy such as 
http://www.cdcfoundation.org/businesspulse/health-costs-resources. 
 
 
 
34 
 
Monitoring and Evaluation   
 
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary components of the public health approach to prevention. 
Timely and reliable data can monitor the extent of the problem and evaluate the impact of prevention 
efforts. Data are essential for successful program implementation. Planning, implementation, and 
assessment all rely on accurate measurement. 
 
Surveillance 
 
Surveillance data (e.g., from surveys or health insurance claims) can provide information such as 
disparities or changes in the burden of asthma. Surveillance systems exist at the federal, state, and 
local levels.  
 
Sources of national asthma data include: 
• National Health Interview Survey (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis)  
• National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes) 
• National Vital Statistics System (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss) 
 
Sources of state or local asthma data include: 
• Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS; http://www.cdc.gov/brfss)  
• BRFSS Asthma Call-back Survey (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/acbs) 
• National Survey of Children’s Health (http://childhealthdata.org/learn/nsch) 
 
The systematic collection, evaluation, interpretation, and dissemination of asthma-related surveillance 
data at the federal, state, and local level can facilitate efficient implementation of this technical 
package (e.g., by identifying populations or areas with higher burden of disease). Additional 
information on available surveillance data and data systems for asthma is available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/asthma/asthmadata.htm.  
 
Evaluation 
 
It is important to track progress of activities to implement the strategies and approaches of this 
technical package and to evaluate the impact of those efforts. Routinely evaluating interventions as 
delivered in respective communities ensures programs are appropriately implemented and achieving 
expected results. In addition to increasing accountability, information generated from program 
evaluations can guide actions for program improvement and enhancement, as well as inform planning 
decisions. Understanding how strategies and approaches are implemented effectively and which 
implementation conditions result in the best outcomes can inform the refinement of asthma control 
activities over time.  
 
In addition, evaluation findings shared with the broader asthma community will add to the evidence 
base and increase awareness of what works within community contexts. Collecting and sharing local 
evaluation data allows communities to make informed decisions when selecting intervention 
35 
 
opportunities with the highest potential impact, continually learn from experience, and build 
community support to sustain success. 
In this way, collecting more data through evaluations of asthma-related programs, practices, and 
policies can enhance the effectiveness of asthma control initiatives, particularly across varied social 
and cultural contexts. Further, evaluation can help improve understanding of the synergistic effects 
that might occur within a comprehensive service system. Resources to assist these evaluation efforts 
are available at http://www.cdc.gov/asthma/program_eval.

Conclusion 
 
The EXHALE technical package represents the best available evidence to improve control of asthma. It 
contains complementary strategies and approaches ideally used in combination in a multi-level, multi-
sector approach to reduce the burden of asthma. The hope is that multiple sectors, such as public 
health, health care, education, social services, and non-governmental organizations, will find this 
technical package useful in improving asthma control.  
 
This technical package is ready for implementation. It reflects the mature evidence base about how to 
control asthma. Monitoring and evaluation will play a key role in refining and maximizing 
implementation of the strategies in EXHALE. As new evidence becomes available, this technical 
package can be refined to reflect the current state of the science.
