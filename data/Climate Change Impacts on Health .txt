Climate Change Impacts on Health
Overview
Health is key to our well-being, happiness, and general quality of life. It is also important for economic progress and productivity. A person’s health may depend on many factors, such as their income, race, gender, age, existing medical conditions or genetics, occupation, and where they live.1 Personal choices and social support structures also play a role in a person’s health.

Climate change also affects people’s health in many ways. As the climate changes, more people may be exposed to extreme weather like heat, floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires.2 These events can cause illness, injury, and even death. Climate change can also lead to more diseases spread by insects and ticks, and it can affect the quality and safety of air, water, and food, including through the spread of harmful bacteria or viruses.3 In addition, hazards related to climate change can stress people’s mental health.4 For information on how climate change can affect the health of different groups of people, see Climate Change and Health.

Difficulty accessing health care. In some places—such as certain rural areas—people can have trouble getting health care since there are fewer hospitals and transportation options.50 Extreme weather worsened by climate change, like floods and storms, can make it even harder for people to access medical facilities.

While the health effects of a changing climate are wide-ranging, communities, health care providers, and individuals can all take steps to lessen these impacts. For example, many government agencies already use the national public warning system to communicate extreme weather threats. Some hospitals are climate-proofing their buildings and becoming more energy efficient. Many cities and individuals are planting trees to reduce the impacts of heat on people’s health.

The Link Between Health and Climate Change

Climate change can disrupt access to health care services, threaten infrastructure, and pose physical and mental health risks. However, health care facilities also emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that contribute to climate change. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from these facilities could reduce the overall cost of health care, benefit the economy, and save lives. Read more about greenhouse gas emissions on the Basics of Climate Change page.

Top Climate Impacts on Health
Health impacts from climate change vary depending on factors like a person’s age, medical condition, income, and where they live. Four key impacts are described in this section.

1. Threats to Safety and Health from Extreme Weather
As the climate changes, some extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and/or intense,  posing risks to people’s health and safety. For instance, droughts can create dust, which can lead to respiratory illness.6 Storms and floods can cause injuries, damage to homes and buildings, and infections from contaminated water.7 Weather can also keep people from getting to doctor’s offices and emergency care.8 Disrupted services are a particular risk for those who need regular medical care, such as older adults, pregnant women, infants, children, or people with chronic illnesses.

Temperatures are also likely to rise in many places as the climate changes. Exposure to extreme or prolonged heat can cause exhaustion, heat stroke, kidney and heart disease, and pregnancy complications.9,10 In fact, extreme heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States.11

2. Threats to Water, Food, and Air Quality

Children are especially vulnerable to lung illnesses and complications from asthma when they are exposed to ground-level ozone and wildfire smoke.
Extreme weather and heat caused by a changing climate affects the quality of water, food, and air. Rising temperatures can lead to harmful algal blooms, many of which produce toxins that make people sick.12 Increased rainfall, storms, and flooding can contaminate water resources with viruses and bacteria, causing gastrointestinal and other illnesses.13 Rising temperatures also contribute to drought and reduced snowpack, ultimately reducing the availability of certain drinking water supplies.14

Climate change impacts on food vary widely. Longer growing seasons may be helpful for some crops, but detrimental to others. Taken together, these changes will present added challenges to farmers looking to plant successful crops that sustain their livelihood. A warmer climate may also lead to more pests or limit the types of crops that can grow in an area.15 This may make it harder for some people to access safe, nutritious food. In addition, climate change may increase people’s exposure to certain bacteria that can cause illnesses, such as Salmonella or E. coli.16

Climate-related extreme weather and heat can worsen air quality. Wildfires and dust from droughts can increase outdoor air pollution.17 Hot weather can increase ground-level ozone.18 Bacteria and mold from flooding can lead to pollutants indoors.19 Poor air quality poses human health risks, including heart disease and stroke, asthma and other respiratory diseases, pregnancy complications, and some cancers.20,21

3. Insect- and Tick-Related Diseases

Deer ticks that may spread Lyme disease are most active from April to October.
Warmer temperatures have widened the range where ticks can live.22 Ticks may carry Lyme disease, which can cause long-term illness if not treated properly.23 Since 1991, the incidence of Lyme disease in the United States has nearly doubled.24

Warmer temperatures also create conditions that help mosquitoes thrive. For example, among several factors that can affect West Nile virus transmission, mild winters, which may be more frequent due to climate change, have been linked to outbreaks of the disease.25

4. Threats to Mental Health and Well-Being
Both immediate and long-term climate change effects can contribute to mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. For instance, climate-related natural disasters can be traumatic, especially for children.26 Natural disasters can lead to a loss of stability, community, and sometimes one’s home or property. Households that experience floods report higher levels of anxiety and depression, sometimes for years afterwards.27 Natural disasters and droughts can also lead to more tobacco and alcohol use, as well as domestic violence.28, 29 In addition, heat overall has been linked to increases in violence.30

For more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate Assessment.

Health and the Economy

High temperatures and poor air quality have both been linked to heart disease, which is one of the costliest illnesses for U.S. employers.34, 35
Compromised health conditions—both short- and long-term—can pose major costs to people, communities, and businesses. These illnesses can hinder economic growth and limit people’s opportunities to work, attend school, and maintain their social relationships.31

Physical and mental health conditions can make it harder for people to do their jobs and can lead to missed workdays and lost wages.32 Missed workdays due to chronic medical conditions cost U.S. employers billions of dollars every year.33

Environmental Justice and Equity
Young child and grandparent observe something outside of the frame.
People can be part of more than one vulnerable group. For instance, some children have disabilities, and some older adults have chronic illnesses.
Some people will be more affected by climate change than others because of social and economic factors. For instance, low-income households may live in aging or poorly constructed buildings that lack adequate cooling during heat waves.36 These households may also struggle to prepare for and recover from storms, floods, and other climate-related disasters.37 Those with limited financial resources also may lack adequate health insurance or access to health care.

For Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities, a changing climate might threaten traditional crops or other food sources.38 This could cause food insecurity and mental health impacts for some people in these communities.

In Alaska, thawing permafrost affects the structure of grounds and roads, which can lead to injuries and community displacement for Tribe members.39 Tribes in remote or rural areas may also have less access to clean, safe water as climate impacts, such as flooding, increase.40

Some groups, like immigrants and communities of color, may face discrimination, language barriers, and other obstacles that can exclude them from community planning processes. As a result, their neighborhoods may be less prepared for climate change.41 They may also have a harder time accessing information to help them become more resilient. At the same time, minority communities may be at higher risk of certain chronic illnesses, such as asthma or heart disease.42 Climate change effects, like poor air quality and increased heat, can worsen these illnesses.

People with chronic illnesses or disabilities may experience disruptions to their medical care during weather emergencies. In addition, alerts and instructions may not be accessible for people with certain disabilities, such as hearing loss, vision loss, or some cognitive disabilities. People with limited mobility may also have a harder time getting to safety or accessing medical care.43

What We Can Do
A young man holds a seedling to be planted.
Planting trees can keep communities cool, improve air quality, and control flooding and runoff. Green spaces offer areas for recreation and help lower stress levels.
Health care facilities, communities, and individuals can reduce climate change’s impacts on human health in many ways. Some actions include:

Use clean energy in health care facilities. Investing in clean energy can help hospitals become more resilient and cost-efficient in the face of climate change. Clean energy also helps reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change. 
Seek medical care. Talk to your health care provider if you think your health is being affected by climate change or your local environment.
Get to know your community. Partner with local organizations and create a community-based approach to prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme weather events.
Learn about local waterways. Check out the condition of water bodies near your home to see if they are safe for swimming. 
Go for the green. Green roofs, greenways, trees, and other green infrastructure all help reduce the urban heat island effect and absorb rainwater to prevent flooding. They also provide benefits like improved air quality and habitat for wildlife.
Protect against insects and ticks. Where possible, wear long pants and sleeves outdoors, and use an EPA-approved bug repellant. Check where outbreaks of Lyme disease and West Nile virus are happening nearby (or in places you’re about to travel to). 
Improve indoor air quality. Reduce or remove sources of indoor air pollutants whenever possible. For example, consider using portable air purifiers or high-efficiency filters in your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.

Climate Change Impacts on Health
Overview
Health is key to our well-being, happiness, and general quality of life. It is also important for economic progress and productivity. A person’s health may depend on many factors, such as their income, race, gender, age, existing medical conditions or genetics, occupation, and where they live.1 Personal choices and social support structures also play a role in a person’s health.

Climate change also affects people’s health in many ways. As the climate changes, more people may be exposed to extreme weather like heat, floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires.2 These events can cause illness, injury, and even death. Climate change can also lead to more diseases spread by insects and ticks, and it can affect the quality and safety of air, water, and food, including through the spread of harmful bacteria or viruses.3 In addition, hazards related to climate change can stress people’s mental health.4 For information on how climate change can affect the health of different groups of people, see Climate Change and Health.

Health and the Economy

High temperatures and poor air quality have both been linked to heart disease, which is one of the costliest illnesses for U.S. employers.34, 35
Compromised health conditions—both short- and long-term—can pose major costs to people, communities, and businesses. These illnesses can hinder economic growth and limit people’s opportunities to work, attend school, and maintain their social relationships.31

Physical and mental health conditions can make it harder for people to do their jobs and can lead to missed workdays and lost wages.32 Missed workdays due to chronic medical conditions cost U.S. employers billions of dollars every year.33

Environmental Justice and Equity
Young child and grandparent observe something outside of the frame.
People can be part of more than one vulnerable group. For instance, some children have disabilities, and some older adults have chronic illnesses.
Some people will be more affected by climate change than others because of social and economic factors. For instance, low-income households may live in aging or poorly constructed buildings that lack adequate cooling during heat waves.36 These households may also struggle to prepare for and recover from storms, floods, and other climate-related disasters.37 Those with limited financial resources also may lack adequate health insurance or access to health care.

For Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities, a changing climate might threaten traditional crops or other food sources.38 This could cause food insecurity and mental health impacts for some people in these communities.

In Alaska, thawing permafrost affects the structure of grounds and roads, which can lead to injuries and community displacement for Tribe members.39 Tribes in remote or rural areas may also have less access to clean, safe water as climate impacts, such as flooding, increase.40

Some groups, like immigrants and communities of color, may face discrimination, language barriers, and other obstacles that can exclude them from community planning processes. As a result, their neighborhoods may be less prepared for climate change.41 They may also have a harder time accessing information to help them become more resilient. At the same time, minority communities may be at higher risk of certain chronic illnesses, such as asthma or heart disease.42 Climate change effects, like poor air quality and increased heat, can worsen these illnesses.

People with chronic illnesses or disabilities may experience disruptions to their medical care during weather emergencies. In addition, alerts and instructions may not be accessible for people with certain disabilities, such as hearing loss, vision loss, or some cognitive disabilities. People with limited mobility may also have a harder time getting to safety or accessing medical care.43

What We Can Do
A young man holds a seedling to be planted.
Planting trees can keep communities cool, improve air quality, and control flooding and runoff. Green spaces offer areas for recreation and help lower stress levels.
Health care facilities, communities, and individuals can reduce climate change’s impacts on human health in many ways. Some actions include:

Use clean energy in health care facilities. Investing in clean energy can help hospitals become more resilient and cost-efficient in the face of climate change. Clean energy also helps reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change. 
Seek medical care. Talk to your health care provider if you think your health is being affected by climate change or your local environment.
Get to know your community. Partner with local organizations and create a community-based approach to prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme weather events.
Learn about local waterways. Check out the condition of water bodies near your home to see if they are safe for swimming. 
Go for the green. Green roofs, greenways, trees, and other green infrastructure all help reduce the urban heat island effect and absorb rainwater to prevent flooding. They also provide benefits like improved air quality and habitat for wildlife.
Protect against insects and ticks. Where possible, wear long pants and sleeves outdoors, and use an EPA-approved bug repellant. Check where outbreaks of Lyme disease and West Nile virus are happening nearby (or in places you’re about to travel to). 
Improve indoor air quality. Reduce or remove sources of indoor air pollutants whenever possible. For example, consider using portable air purifiers or high-efficiency filters in your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.
