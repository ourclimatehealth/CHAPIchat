The Costs of Inaction: 
The Economic Burden of Fossil
Fuels and Climate Change on
Health in the United States
Fossil fuel combustion and global climate change are harming our health on multiple
fronts. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is one of the leading causes of illness and
premature deaths in the United States and the world.   Beyond air pollution, the burning
of fossil fuels is changing our climate by increasing levels of heat-trapping pollution such
as carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere. Those rising temperatures are fueling more
extreme weather and contributing to dangerous heat waves, dramatic spikes in air
pollution, and increases in tick and mosquito-borne infectious disease outbreaks. These
impacts are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, duration, and/or geographic
range in the decades to come, with the potential to trigger profound increases in harm to
public health in the U.S.

In this report, we conclude that the health costs of air pollution and climate change
already far exceed $800 billion per year and are expected to become even more
expensive in years to come without a stronger societal response to address this
crisis. This price tag most likely vastly underestimates the true total costs of these
problems, due to limited available health data. These large and growing  financial
costs—as well as the major health harms of air pollution and climate change—are
often overlooked. Now is the time to recognize how much these linked problems
are costing us. 
Overview
The Health Costs of Inaction on Climate Change    1
The climate crisis is a dangerous and costly problem, and it threatens much more than
just property values and infrastructure: it’s fueling substantial and sometimes
irreversible damage to public health in terms of illnesses, injuries, expensive medical
bills, and deaths. A wealth of scientific research indicates that this problem will
contribute to an extraordinary rise in a wide variety of health problems and demand for
medical care if we don't take action to avert the climate crisis. The growing burden of
health harms and healthcare costs is already straining people and communities,    which
is especially worrisome given that more than half of U.S. adults currently report medical
financial hardship  — that is, the inability to afford medical care, no matter how
necessary it is. Climate change is a “threat multiplier”..  that is worsening existing health
and economic burdens, particularly for the most vulnerable among us, including
children, low-income communities, and people of color.

Reducing heat-trapping pollution and investing in community preparedness can provide
valuable immediate and long-term safeguards to our health and wellbeing. These actions
can be supported by fully accounting for the sizeable financial and health costs of climate
inaction. This report summarizes scientific evidence of the large health burden of recent
climate change-related events in the United States, describes how those health problems
trigger large treatment costs that burden people and families         , and offers
recommendations for ways to weave health and economic arguments into advocacy for
climate action.

Coal, oil, and natural gas are major types of fossil fuels — energy sources derived from burning the remains of
prehistoric plants and animals.   The extraction, refining, transport, and combustion of fossil fuels release toxic
pollution into the air,  soil,  and water.    The combustion emission components with the greatest impact on human
health which are the focus of this report include sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and microscopic particle pollution.
These pollutants can each harm health directly, while also contributing to the formation of additional particle
pollution and ground-level ozone smog -- further amplifying the potential health harms of these emissions.
The climate crisis fuels dangerous environmental changes that are harming people and families across the country,
like more extreme weather and stronger hurricanes, increasingly severe wildfires, intense heat waves, more
dangerous air pollution episodes, an expanded range for insect-borne infectious diseases, and longer allergy seasons. .
These climate change-related events are expected to increase in frequency, intensity, duration, and/or geographic
range in the future, absent strong reductions in greenhouse gas pollution.   The health consequences of a rapidly
changing climate are here and now, and they are dangerous and costly for people to treat and recover from.

The Health Costs of Inaction on Climate Change   2
Medical treatment and recovery from the many types of health problems worsened by climate change is expensive
and burdens patients, employers, public and private insurers, and health system operators. Extreme weather events
commonly require people to seek medical care in emergency rooms, hospitals, and non-emergency healthcare
settings. When patients are admitted to a hospital to treat severe illnesses and injuries, they may also forego income
at work, triggering hardship for themselves and their families. The costs can continue to add up once patients are
discharged from hospitals, because of the possible need for ongoing outpatient care and medications. Research on the
health costs of climate change related-events categorizes how these staggering costs add up:
Climate change-related events like heat waves, wildfires, and hurricanes are often deadly. To assign value
to the economic risk of premature deaths, the U.S. federal government applies a metric called the Value
of a Statistical Life. The economic burden of early deaths is typically the major driver of costs in climate
and health cost assessments.
PREMATURE DEATHS
What are the types of health costs from fossil fuels and
climate change?
MEDICAL CARE FOR TREATMENT OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS
Direct treatment costs in hospitals, emergency rooms, and clinics can come with a steep price tag for
patients. Mental health treatment for people experiencing conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) after a disaster is another component of these costs.
REHABILITATION AND HOME HEALTH CARE
Even after completion of immediate treatment, some patients require continuing medical care to
manage and recover from their health problems, including mental health counseling or physical therapy.
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS
Filling prescriptions for medications (sometimes more than once) can be costly for patients.
LOST WAGES AND WORKER PRODUCTIVITY
While patients are receiving necessary medical care, they may lose wages at work. Unscheduled medical
absences and stress-related lack of productivity tied to healthcare needs also affect worker productivity
and business operations.
DOWNSTREAM HEALTH COSTS
Climate events can harm health and trigger other costs in complex ways by destabilizing individuals,
families, and communities. People can suffer from other health problems after climate disasters,
including those linked to delayed care and homelessness.
The Health Costs of Inaction on Climate Change   3
According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program,      populations at higher risk of climate harms (and associated
health costs) include economically disadvantaged groups, some communities of color, immigrant groups (especially
those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, outdoor
workers, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions. These vulnerabilities
stem from a combination of factors, including lack of access to affordable health insurance and care, systemic racism,
longstanding and inequitable land use and zoning rules, the concentration of polluting facilities in economically
marginalized areas, health status, and occupational risks. 
Additionally, many people lack the resources to prepare for and adapt to the multiple, sometimes cascading and
compounding health risks of a changing climate.    Research indicates that Medicare and Medicaid patients are not
only among the most vulnerable groups to the health effects of climate change, but also shoulder the highest share of
climate-sensitive health costs to treat illness.    Because these public health insurance programs are funded by
taxpayer dollars, we are all shouldering the health costs of climate change. The climate crisis could also trigger a
demand for more home health care needs, an essential function that is often performed by women, people of color,
and often inadequately compensated.    In short, the health costs of the climate crisis widen existing economic
inequality.
Estimating the national health cost of fossil fuels and climate change is challenging because of limited data
availability on injuries and illnesses resulting from specific weather extremes.    As a result, U.S. government
estimates of the cost of climate/weather disasters tend to omit the health-related costs altogether.   Importantly,
existing cost estimates often focus on impacts that are immediate and most easily quantified, underestimating the
total health impacts (and costs) of the long-term disease burden.
Despite this gap, peer-reviewed scientific literature shows that people in the United States are already burdened by
health 
health costs of air pollution and climate change that far exceed
$800 billion per year.  Unfortunately, many Americans likely
experience multiple climate change-related events and
associated costs simultaneously. The following set of tables
provides a list of major health threats linked to fossil fuel-
triggered air pollution  and climate change-related events, along
with a sample of cost estimates for these types of health harms, if
available (normalized to 2020 USD)....

PARTICULATE MATTER
Health Costs of Poor
Air Quality
Fossil fuel burning (coal in particular) releases deadly particulate matter
(PM) and PM precursors, and climate change affects PM through
increases in airborne dust and wildfires in parts of the United States.    PM
and PM precursors are the most deadly and costly major components of
air pollution.    PM2.5 exposure is associated with cardiovascular disease
and respiratory conditions such as lung cancer. It is also associated with
altered nervous system, metabolic, reproductive, and developmental
outcomes.
GROUND-LEVEL OZONE (SMOG)
Precursors emitted by fossil fuel combustion, combined with higher temperatures fueled by climate change,
increase ozone production.  Ozone is known to cause harmful respiratory outcomes such as asthma
exacerbation, and may also worsen cardiovascular, metabolic, nervous system, and reproductive outcomes.
AIRBORNE ALLERGENS
Rising temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing the duration, geographic extent,
and intensity of pollen seasons. Fossil fuel pollution exposure in humans can worsen allergic responses. These
factors can exacerbate allergic diseases such as asthma,  hay  fever,  rhinitis,  and atopic dermatitis.

Rising temperatures, drought conditions, and insect outbreaks linked to

large wildfires.   From 1984 to 2015, climate change doubled the area of
burned land from forest fires in the Western United States.     Wildfires
can cause premature death and injuries, and endanger respiratory and
cardiovascular health through the generation of toxic air pollution.
EXTREME PRECIPITATION, HURRICANES, AND COASTAL STORMS
Climate change has contributed to increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, North Atlantic
hurricanes, and flooding over the past several decades.    These disasters cause trauma and death directly and can
exacerbate chronic conditions. Infrastructure loss after a disaster can lead to pathogenic food and water-borne
infections.   In the aftermath, the recovery process poses a heavy toll on the mental health of survivors,
particularly for those who are already vulnerable, such as pregnant women.

Climate change drives higher average temperatures and more intense heat waves.   Climate change has at least
doubled the likelihood of record-breaking hot summer days in the United States between 1961-2010.    Heat stress
leads to hyperthermia-related conditions such as heatstroke, can worsen existing cardiovascular, respiratory,
cerebrovascular, and diabetes-related conditions, and can harm perinatal outcomes.

HEALTH PROBLEMS LINKED TO FOOD AND WATER
The existing evidence is clear: the climate crisis and fossil fuel use are extremely costly, both in terms of damage to
human health and economic hardship on vulnerable communities. But smart climate actions now to reduce fossil fuel
emissions and prepare communities for climate change-related health harms can reduce suffering and transform
health costs into major financial savings.    The following recommendations identify climate solutions for public
health across three groups: individuals, health professionals, and policymakers. 
Climate/weather-related disasters, extreme heat, and climate change-associated anxiety (“ecological grief”) can
have far-reaching mental health implications.   However, few studies estimate the associated costs. Mental
health issues are a highly costly medical condition in the United States,    so the mental health costs of climate
change-related events are an important area for future investigation.  
Substituting active transportation (walking and biking) and public transportation (bus, subway,
trains) for car use, when possible, reduces pollution emissions and improves people’s health.
Ridesharing when active and public transportation options are unavailable can cut costs and
emissions as well.
Decarbonizing Our Energy, Transportation, and Food
Systems Improves Health and Reduces Costs
Atmospheric carbon dioxide, rising temperatures, and extreme
climate/weather events increase risk of (1) pathogenic and chemical
contamination of food and water, (2) decreased protein and mineral
content
Beyond these documented costs, other climate change-related health
problems likely burden people with additional health-related costs. These
costs include:
content in some crops, and (3) disruption of critical supply chains...  Despite health threats from gastrointestinal
illness (e.g. harmful algal blooms), neurological damage (e.g. methylmercury in seafood), and food insecurity,
the health cost implications have only been estimated in a few instances.
What Many of Us Can Do
Most everyone can engage in climate solutions by making small, health-positive improvements to their daily habits. 
Physical inactivity costs the United States an estimated $27 billion annually in productivity
losses and healthcare for preventable conditions such as coronary artery disease and type II
diabetes.

Building resilience to climate/weather-related disasters in the healthcare sector and beyond will
help treat patients more effectively and reduce health problems and costs in a warming world. 
Eating healthy foods, reducing meat consumption, and increasing consumption of fruits,
vegetables and whole grains can improve people’s health, reduce healthcare costs, and reduce
food-related climate pollution. 
In the United States, health care produces a large and growing amount of heat-trapping pollution,
but the healthcare sector’s large climate footprint can be reduced without compromising quality..
As trusted messengers on health issues, health professionals can communicate the health risks and costs of climate
change and fossil fuel use to patients and colleagues. Health professionals can help to strengthen climate action
through specific efforts:
 
We must factor in the changing climate into our diagnostic and treatment plans, and teach our
trainees to do the same, to reduce the severity of climate-fueled health harms.
What Health Professionals Can Do
ADOPT SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHY DIETS 
PUSH TO DECARBONIZE THE HEALTH SECTOR 
ADVOCATE FOR CLIMATE READY HEALTH SYSTEMS
INTEGRATE CLIMATE CHANGE INTO HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE
Global adoption of the low carbon planetary health diet (reduces animal-source foods in lieu
of plant-based foods) would prevent about 11 million deaths globally each year.
In 2018, U.S. healthcare sector greenhouse gas emissions made up 8.5% of total countrywide
domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from the U.S. healthcare sector are among the
highest (in absolute and per capita terms) of any healthcare sector in the world.
Advocate for strong emergency preparedness protocol within healthcare facilities, to ensure swift
adaptation to the devastating health and infrastructure damage from climate/weather-related
disasters such as wildfires, floods, and hurricanes. 
Be aware of  local health-promoting adaptation measures such as early heat warning systems and
public cooling centers, and share this information with patients.
Whenever appropriate, provide patients with health-positive recommendations that are climate-
positive as well — such as using active transport when possible, and reducing consumption of meat
and processed foods.
Incorporate environmental/occupational health into history taking, including attention towards air
conditioner access and vulnerable workers (including outdoor laborers) during the summer months.
Understand the effects of climate change on medication — for example, the impact of certain
antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and antihistamines on heat intolerance.

Nationwide zero-emission transportation would reduce air pollution and avoid up to an estimated
$76.7  billion in health costs in 2050 from 6,300 averted premature deaths, 93,000 averted asthma
attacks, and 416,000 averted missed work days.     Particular attention is needed to ensure a just
transition and improve safe access to zero-emission transportation options, including sidewalks, bike
lanes, and zero-emission public transportation. 
From 2007 to 2015, wind energy avoided 6,700 premature deaths from air pollution, with an estimated
value of $59.1 billion.     Equitable access to clean energy will curb the toxic effects of fossil fuel
emissions, particularly in disenfranchised communities where emissions take the largest toll.
Elected leaders at the local, state, and federal levels have an important role to play in reducing systemic environmental
inequality and ensuring that climate and health solutions are accessible to everyone. Climate policy should include
measures to reduce climate change-related health problems and their high costs. Specifically, policymakers and policy
advocates can advance policy changes on several fronts:
A just transition away from fossil fuel use in energy, transportation, and food systems (while increasing reliance on
renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy) will curb harmful and costly emissions.
Building resilience against climate change-related events will reduce damage in the future. 
Improving access and demand for affordable, high-quality planet-friendly foods can support the health
of communities and the climate. Solutions include expanding food waste reduction efforts,
community composting programs, and local food production, and incentivizing the purchase of
planet-friendly  foods.

The climate crisis is extremely costly, in terms of both damage to human health and the economic hardship
that climate-fueled problems impose on vulnerable individuals and communities. By recognizing the
dangerous and expensive health consequences of climate change, we can make the case for climate policies
that will reduce costly suffering — now, and for years to come.
The Health Costs of Inaction on Climate Change   10
Overall, the vast majority of the health costs identified in our report come from a method that provides a valuation
of reducing premature mortality risk, known as the “Value of a Statistical Life (VSL).”     These mortality-related
cost estimates are not the same as those related to traditional health care that are typically incurred to treat
illnesses. 
The VSL estimates comprise the vast majority of the total damages identified in our report and provide an
important way to represent premature loss of life in economic terms. 
When we discuss the costs of premature mortality measured by this VSL, our cited publications applied an
estimation method for the economic valuation of premature death, rather than an out-of-pocket cost or medical
bill for health services. For example, one could say that the VSL indicates how much a large group of people would
be 
 
We would like to provide some more information to further clarify the methods we used in our climate-health cost
valuation report so that its findings are more clearly interpreted, summarized, and reported. 
Headlines and stories generated from the report’s initial release suggested or directly stated that climate change is
tied to more than $820 billion in health care costs per year. This prompted us to provide the following, in which we
highlight four points with a more detailed description of the cost estimates and clarification on the nature of the costs
we report.

A Deeper Look at Our Reporting Methods
1.
WHO IS PAYING FOR THE HEALTH CARE COSTS WE IDENTIFIED?
2.
For the illness-related costs, the expected payer can sometimes be determined from the datasets used to assemble
the cost estimates. The report does not intend to imply that all of the estimated costs are borne by vulnerable
people, nor by the general public through Medicare and Medicaid premiums, to which taxpayers contribute. The
VSL estimates associated with premature deaths are not out-of-pocket expenses being directly paid by individuals,
and those costs comprise the vast majority of the total economic burden identified in the report.

be willing to pay to avoid or reduce the risk of premature death from
health harms caused by environmental conditions.
To emphasize this distinction again: the overwhelming majority of
the costs estimated in our report are those associated with
premature mortality, via the VSL method.
 
This report includes both the health costs of fossil fuel-related air pollution and the health costs related to events
sensitive to climate change, to varying degrees. Today, fossil fuel-related air pollution generates the majority of
these costs, largely derived from the economic value of air pollution-related premature deaths. For example, the
$820 billion figure highlighted in our report refers exclusively to the economic impact of premature deaths
associated with fossil fuel-generated air pollution. Other cost estimates identified in our report (above and beyond
the $820 billion) encompass both premature mortality and illness-related costs for specific types of climate-
related events. We did not sum together the other cost estimates presented in each exposure category, because
they are derived from different studies over different years that employed distinct methodologies.
But in the future, say 30 years from now when today’s children are middle-aged, and assuming that cleaner, non-
polluting energy sources are more prevalent, fossil fuel-related health harms would decline. However, climate
change-related health costs are projected to rise to tens to hundreds of billions annually by the end of this century,   
greater than those same costs today. The good news is, if we move away from reliance on fossil fuels now, we can
limit both types of costs – both today’s fossil fuel air pollution costs; and the future costs from a range of climate
change-sensitive health hazards exacerbated by the impact of fossil fuel-related greenhouse gas emissions on
climate change.

The report might seem to suggest that people are paying out over $800 billion dollars from their pockets every year,
for health costs caused by climate change. This interpretation, however, blurs the distinction between climate-
attributable (caused) health outcomes and what the report identifies as "climate change-related" (elsewhere
referred to as “climate-sensitive”     ) health outcomes. To help avert confusion, we’re providing this clarification.
The report combined findings from prior studies that were not causal climate change “attribution” analyses.
Climate attribution studies apply statistical modeling techniques in order to quantitatively examine the link
between climate change’s influence on a particular event and associated health harms. Rather, this report compiled
information from prior studies on a range of climate-sensitive health problems -- those expected to worsen in
frequency, intensity, duration, or areal extent in the future, due to climate change. For example, in the report,
substantial costs are associated with vector-borne diseases whose climate change attribution is unknown, and
likely limited at this time.     To be clear, climate change is not currently responsible for 100% of the costs that were
tallied in the report. While research in attributing climate change’s contribution to specific environmental events is
advancing rapidly,      that attribution is not the focus of the studies compiled in this report.
