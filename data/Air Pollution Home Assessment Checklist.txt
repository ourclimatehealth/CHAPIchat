A trained home visitor can help find common asthma triggers in homes and discuss ways to reduce 
and remove triggers.  Removing asthma triggers in the home, along with proper medical care can 
improve health.
The checklist is organized into a Core Assessment plus two appendices (Dust Mite Module and Mold 
and Moisture Module).  The Core Assessment can be used for all types of housing and climates, but the 
additional modules can be used if dust mites or mold/moisture issues are suspected by the trained home 
visitor.  The suggested action items in this checklist are generally simple and low cost. 
Using this Home Assessment Can Help Make Homes Healthier.
Combustion by-products
Triggers: Particles and gases that are formed when fuel 
is burned.
Where Found: Gas cooking appliances, fireplaces, 
woodstoves, candles, incense, cigarettes, and unvented 
kerosene and gas space heaters.
Dust Mites
Triggers: Body parts and droppings.
Where Found: Mattresses, bedding, carpeting, curtains, 
upholstered furniture, and stuffed toys. Dust mites are too 
small to be seen with the naked eye. They can survive in a 
range of climates, but they prefer high humidity.
Mold
Triggers: Mold spores, fragments, and odors.
Where Found: Indoor mold growth is often found in areas 
with more moisture such as kitchens, bathrooms, and 
basements, or areas where water damage has occurred. There 
are many types of mold and they can be found in any climate.
Pests
Triggers: Cockroaches—Body parts and droppings. 
Rodents—Fur, skin flakes, and urine.
Where Found: Areas with food and water such as kitchens, 
bathrooms, and basements.
Pets with fur
Triggers: Fur, skin flakes, and saliva.
Where Found: Throughout entire home.
Secondhand Smoke
Triggers: Mix of smoke from the burning end of 
a cigarette, pipe, or cigar and the smoke exhaled 
by a smoker.
Where Found: Anywhere that smoking is allowed.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
Triggers: Chemical vapors that come from household items.
Where Found: Products such as cleaning agents, 
deodorizers, air fresheners, perfumes, paints, nail polish, 
and nail polish remover.

to remove the pet from the home and thoroughly clean all surfaces in 
the home.
●
●If you are allergic, and cannot remove the pet from your home, you can 
decrease exposure, but it might not be enough to decrease symptoms. 
The best way to decrease symptoms is to do all of these things:
»
» Keep pets out of your bedroom,
»
» Wash your furry pets,
»
» Use an air cleaner with HEPA filter,
»
» Use allergen-proof mattress & pillow covers.
