How air pollution is destroying our healthChildren and air pollution10 ways you can fight air pollution10 Things to Know About Air Pollution
Six reasons to protect babies and children from air pollution
Their lungs are still developing, and air pollution can interfere with this biological process
Their bodies are less able to metabolize, detoxify, and excrete the toxicants contained in air pollution
Their brains are still developing, and neurotoxic compounds in air pollution can affect children’s cognitive development
They inhale more air per unit of bodyweight than adults
They are more active and therefore breathe in more air pollution
Babies born to women who were exposed to air pollution during their pregnancy are more likely to be premature and low birthweight
Six ways to help protect our children from indoor air pollution
Don’t smoke indoors or near children, but ensure they remain supervised
Use cleaner fuels and technologies to cook, heat and light your home - choose electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, biogas or solar stoves or ovens
Use ultra-low emission stoves with processed solid fuels (wood pellets) if cleaner options are not available
Always cook in a well-ventilated area, or outside if it’s hard to ventilate your kitchen or cooking area
Avoid using kerosene lamps or stoves for cooking or lighting
Don’t burn candles or use air fresheners, which add toxic chemicals to the air
Five ways to help protect children from outdoor air pollution

Stop burning household and agricultural waste. Compost and use local services for recycling and garbage disposal whenever possible
Think about how you can reduce your children’s exposure to air pollution caused by vehicle exhaust emissions. Some possible actions include avoiding busy roads and taking quieter streets with less traffic, stepping back from the road if you see a heavily polluting vehicle approaching, and carrying a baby or young child on a busy street, so they are not at the same height as exhaust emissions
Keep your children healthy – make sure they are up to date with their immunizations, have healthy diets and plenty of opportunity to play and be physically active
Monitor air pollution levels if the city you live in has an air quality monitoring station, and be aware of the effects of air pollution on your children so to know when and how to take protective measures (e.g. stay indoors).
Raise awareness among your community about the health impacts of air pollution, and work with healthcare providers, community leaders, and relevant authorities to promote policies that reduce air pollution and protect child health
