Everyone with asthma needs their own Asthma Action Plan. Work with your health care provider to create a plan that works for you. Your goal is to prevent and control your asthma attacks.

Create your own plan using CDC’s Asthma Action Plan [PDF – 569 KB] tool.

Doing Well
I don’t have cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing at any time.
I can do all the things I usually do.
When I use a peak flow meter my peak flow* is more than 80 percent or more of my best peak flow.
Continue taking your long-term control medicine.
Asthma Is Getting Worse

I have some cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing. Or
I wake up at night because of my asthma. Or
I can’t do some of the things I usually do. Or
When I use a peak flow meter my peak flow* is half to three quarters of my best peak flow.
Add your quick-relief medicine and continue your long-term control medicine.
If your symptoms get better after an hour keep checking them and continue your long-term control medicine.
Medical Alert!

I have a lot of trouble breathing. Or
My quick-relief medicines don’t help. Or
I can’t do any of the things I usually do. Or
I was in the yellow zone for 24 hours and I’m not getting better. Or
When I use a peak flow meter my peak flow* is less than half of my best peak flow.
Add the other medicines your doctor has prescribed and call your doctor.
If your symptoms don’t get better and you can’t reach your doctor, go to the hospital.
*Peak flow measurement is a quick test to measure air flowing out of the lungs.
