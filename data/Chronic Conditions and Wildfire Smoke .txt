Chronic Conditions and Wildfire Smoke
Español (Spanish) Print
People with any chronic condition should take the following steps to protect themselves from wildfire smoke:

Before wildfire season:
Talk to your healthcare provider. Plan how you will protect yourself against wildfire smoke.
Stock up on medicine. Store a 7 to 10-day supply of prescription medicines in a waterproof, childproof container to take with you if you evacuate.
Buy groceries you won’t need to cook. Frying or grilling especially can make indoor air pollution worse.
During a wildfire smoke event:
Pay attention to air quality reports. Follow instructions about exercise and going outside for “sensitive individuals.”
Follow your healthcare provider’s advice and your asthma action plan if you have one.
Think about evacuating if you have trouble breathing or other symptoms that do not get better.
Stay inside as much as possible. Keep windows and doors closed and turn on an HVAC system or use a portable air filtration unit.
If your area is experiencing extreme heat, contact your local health department to find public access air-conditioned centers or cooling centers in your area.
If you must go outdoors during a Wildfire Smoke event, wear an N95 respirator.
Children ages 2 years and older can wear respirators and masks. However, NIOSH Approved respirators do not come in suitable sizes for very young children.
Remember that dust masks, surgical masks, bandanas, and breathing through a wet cloth will not protect your child from smoke.
After a wildfire:
Do not return home until you are told it is safe to do so.
Look out for any symptoms. Contact your healthcare provider if you have trouble breathing, shortness of breath, cough that won’t stop, or other symptoms that do not go away. Call 9-1-1 or go right away to an emergency department for medical emergencies.
Smoke can stay in the air days after wildfires have ended so continue to check local air quality.
