Information for Older Adults and their Caregivers 
Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) is the fourth 
leading cause of 
death in the United 
States. 
More than two 
million adults age 
65 and older have 
asthma, and in 
2004 more than one 
million older adults 
suffered an asthma 
episode.4 
D
id you know that 
Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) is the fourth 
leading cause of death in the 
United States, claiming more 
than 125,000 lives in 2005?1 In 
2006, COPD caused 672,000 
hospitalizations and 1.4 million 
hospital emergency room 
visits.2 COPD includes chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema -
lung diseases which frequently 
coexist and are characterized 
by obstruction to air flow, 
making it difficult to breathe. 
Smokers are particularly at risk 
of developing COPD, however, 
it also has been linked to 
workplace exposure to dust 
and fumes. Symptoms include 
chronic cough, increased 
mucus production, chest 
tightness, shortness of breath 
and difficulty breathing. 
Economic Impact of 
COPD and Asthma 
In 2007, the annual treatment 
cost for all age groups was 
approximately $43 billion for 
COPD.3 COPD is particularly 
common among older adults 
and significantly compromises 
their quality of life. As baby 
boomers age, the number of 
older adults affected by COPD 
and asthma is expected to 
grow significantly. 
Environmental Hazards, 
Triggers for COPD and 
Asthma 
Outdoor Air 
Exposure to air pollution can 
pose a significant risk to older 
adults, especially those with lung 
disease. Particle pollution may 
aggravate lung diseases, including 
COPD and asthma, and may be 
responsible for serious health 
effects, including hospitalization 
or premature death. Ozone also 
may aggravate lung diseases and 
may result in emergency room 
and hospital admissions. 
Indoor Air 
Pollutants that exist within 
homes and buildings also 
may be harmful to persons 
with COPD or asthma. Many 
older persons spend up to 90 
percent of their time indoors, 
often at home. Common indoor 
environmental hazards that 
may trigger COPD and asthma 
attacks include tobacco smoke 
(direct and second-hand smoke), 
animal dander, dust mites and 
cockroaches, mold, dust and 
pollen. Other sources of indoor 
air pollution that may trigger a 
COPD or asthma attack include 
combustion products of oil, gas, 
kerosene and coal, and building 
materials and furnishings made 
of pressed wood products. 
Pesticides, household cleaning 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
products and substances with irritating 
odors also may exacerbate these 
diseases. 
Learn More About EPA’s 
Aging Initiative 
The Aging Initiative is working to protect 
the environmental health of older adults 
through the coordination of research, 
prevention strategies and public 
education. For more information about 
the Aging Initiative, visit www.epa. 
gov/aging. 
A poster entitled “Age Healthier Breathe 
Easier” on COPD, asthma and older 
adults is also available on the website to 
download. 
Pollutants that exist within homes and buildings also may be 
harmful to persons with COPD or asthma. 
 
What you can do to 
control and reduce 
exposure to 
environmental hazards 
If you or your loved one experience symptoms 
of COPD or asthma, consult a doctor and follow 
a management plan outlined by your health 
care provider. The key to management of these 
diseases is through preventive measures and 
reduced exposure to environmental hazards. 
Take steps to prevent, control and reduce the 
frequency of symptoms to allow you or your 
loved one to breathe easier. 
n Avoid tobacco smoke 
n Avoid smoke from wood-burning stoves 
n Reduce mold, dust mites and  
cockroaches in your home  
n Keep pets out of sleeping areas 
n Check furnace and heating units  
annually  
n Fix water leaks promptly 
n Check the Air Quality Index (AQI) 
Reduce outdoor activity as much as possible on 
poor air quality days. The AQI reports how clean 
the air is and whether it will affect your health. 
If you have access to the Internet, you can learn 
more about the AQI by visiting www.epa.gov/ 
airnow.  If you do not have access to a computer 
or the internet, you can learn more about the 
daily AQI through newspaper, television and 
radio weather reports.
