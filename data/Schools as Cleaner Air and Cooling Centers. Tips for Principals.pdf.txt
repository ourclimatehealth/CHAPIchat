Schools as Cleaner Air and Cooling Centers
Tips for Principals and School Administrators
Communities are facing the impacts of climate change, including severe health consequences from 
heat waves and wildfires. EPA launched a pilot project in 2021 called Schools as Community Cleaner 
Air and Cooling Centers to address the combined hazards of extreme heat and wildfire smoke with 
a focus on spaces that serve children. The goals of this project are to support practical strategies for 
safeguarding children in schools during heat and smoke events. 
Principals and school administrators can be champions for upgrades to filtration and cooling systems 
that can keep kids and staff safe during the school day. Important first steps include engaging
partners, especially public health agencies, to understand the risks from extreme heat and wildfire 
smoke and the role that schools can play in keeping community members safe. School leaders can 
work with facilities managers to evaluate HVAC capacity, needs, and gaps for school buildings. Outside 
of building infrastructure, it is important to support training for staff and faculty, develop heat and 
smoke plans, and provide parent and caregiver education and support. This fact sheet can help you 
take the first steps towards upgrading school facilities for extreme heat and wildfire smoke mitigation.
HEALTHY LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 
BENEFIT SCHOOL SYSTEMS
Schools are central to the well-being of some of the most 
vulnerable members of our community. In addition to 
schools confronting challenges posed by the COVID-19 
pandemic, the number of extreme heat and wildfire 
smoke events is on the rise. Keeping children safe and in 
school during dangerous heat and smoke days—in addition 
to improving facilities to meet post-pandemic air quality 
standards—is a strong investment for a school system. 
Healthy learning environments equal higher test scores 
and lower absenteeism. Asthma is a leading cause of 
school absenteeism and poor outdoor and indoor air 
quality are the leading causes.  Students with uncontrolled 
asthma score lower on standardized tests than other 
students.1 Higher temperatures in the classroom can 
not only be hazardous to children’s health, but can also 
adversely impact student performance on academic 
work.2 Even modest improvements in room temperatures 
have been shown to positively affect a student’s ability to 
perform tasks successfully, especially those that require 
concentration. 
Schools and their partners can make investments that 
alleviate these barriers to learning, help keep schools open 
as a critical resource during heat and smoke events, while 
also improving the performance and outcomes 
for students.

WHO IS THE MOST AT RISK?
At the start of the pilot projects, EPA worked with counties 
and school districts to conduct risk assessments to identify 
which neighborhoods and schools were most in need 
of air quality and cooling improvements. This process 
involved mapping and screening using categories of data 
that identify and evaluate the geographic areas that are 
more at risk to heat and smoke and groups of people that 
are most vulnerable. Some schools may be located in 
neighborhoods serving people who are more vulnerable 
than others to health impacts of climate change due to 
social and economic factors. Figure 1 provides an example 
of the categories of data that can be used to prioritize 
facility upgrades. Schools may need to work with local 
or county GIS staff, if available, to do this mapping and 
assessment. And this process will be more relevant 
for larger school districts with many facilities serving 
different populations.

WHO WILL USE THIS CENTER?
School administrators and decision makers will need 
to discuss if it is appropriate to open to the school as a 
cleaner air or cooling centers to members of the public 
outside of school hours. For instance, the facility could 
be open to families of students or specified at-risk 
members of the nearby neighborhood. Rural schools may 
already be used for broader community events and have 
plans in place to make facilities open to the public. Based 
on these conversations and policies, different groups 
should be included in the decision-making team for the 
school. The chart below outlines typical community 
partners to engage:
WHO SHOULD BE ON YOUR TEAM?
- Public Health Agencies
- School District Leadership 
- Local School Leadership
- School Facilities Managers

WHAT SPACES WILL YOU USE?
Investments can be made for a specific space within your 
school building that could be used as a designated area 
during extreme heat and smoke event days. The best 
spaces include those with the following features:
1.	 High occupancy densities
2.	 High cooling capacities
3.	 Have permanent or temporary standby power 
capability
4.	 Won’t impact normal school operations or function by 
their use
5.	 Example spaces include: Gymnasiums, Auditorium, 
Performing Arts Centers, Cafeteria
