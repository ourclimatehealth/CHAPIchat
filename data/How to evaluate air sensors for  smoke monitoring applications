Overview of Today’s Presentation
• Need for air sensors to monitor smoke
• EPA’s initial guidance provided by performance targets for PM2.5 sensors
• Recommendations for additional evaluations for sensors used for smoke monitoring
• Considerations associated with reference monitor measurements during smoke
• Review of air sensor related resources
2
Why do we need sensors for 
smoke monitoring applications?
3
Wildfire smoke is increasing
• Wildfires contribute more than 
40% of all PM2.5 emissions in 
the US (NEI2017)
• Wildfire smoke has resulted in 
increasing concentrations in 
the west, opposite the long-
term decreasing 
anthropogenic PM2.5 trends 
(McClure and Jaffe 2018) 
• Estimated economic impact of 
wildfire attributed PM2.5 is 
immense (Fann et al., 2018)
• Short-term exposure: $11-20 
billion/yr
• Long-term exposure: $76-130 
billion/yr
Annual Avg. 
burned 1983-1999
2.9 million acres
Annual Avg. burned 
2000-2020 7 
million acres

Smoke concentrations can vary greatly in 
space and time
• Active fire areas can generate localized 
high concentration plumes
• Topography can strongly impact spatial 
variation of smoke concentrations
• Wind shifts and diurnal flows can cause 
rapid concentration changes
Sensors allow for more measurements, 
often at higher time resolution, than 
the ambient monitoring network → 
more timely and localized  public 
health information

Smoke impacts vary by region and by season
• Wildland fires occur 
across the US
• Some regions have 
seasonal fires that differ 
from wildfire conditions
• Spring grassland fires in 
the midwest
• Winter pile burns in the 
west
• Winter prescribed forest 
fires in the southeast
• Fall agricultural residue 
burns in the south
• Vegetation varies across 
the country and may 
impact PM2.5
characteristics
6
Other smoke sources also have high spatial 
and temporal variation
• Wood stove use and recreational 
burning can cause localized high 
PM2.5 concentrations in the 
wintertime (NEI2017)
• Inversions that frequently setup in 
mountain valleys can further 
concentrate emissions and result in 
stratified layers of PM2.5 at different 
elevations (Chen et al. 2012)

Performance Testing Protocols, 
Metrics, and Target Values for 
PM2.5 Air Sensors
11
Intention and Scope of EPA’s Performance 
Testing Protocols, Metrics, and Targets
• Intention: The goal to provide a 
consistent approach for performance 
testing and reporting results to help users 
identify sensors that meet their needs
• Scope
• Focus on non-regulatory, supplemental and 
informational monitoring applications 
(NSIM)
• Ambient, outdoor, fixed site environments
Smoke monitoring fits the NSIM application space. Most 
monitoring is for outdoor and fixed site environments BUT, 
the concentration range is typically wider than is typically 
experienced for ambient monitoring.

• Reports provide recommendations for evaluating 
sensor performance
• Conducting the testing protocols is entirely 
voluntary
• Conducting the testing protocols does not constitute 
certification or endorsement by the US EPA
• EPA does not provide funding to conduct the testing 
protocols
• EPA recommends that testers share results on their 
respective websites

Base Testing (Field)
Enhanced Testing (Laboratory)
• Evaluate sensors in the field – ambient, 
outdoor, fixed site environment
• Purpose
•
Obtain information on sensor 
performance in real-world, ambient, 
outdoor conditions
•
Provides consumers information on 
how they might expect a sensor to 
perform in similar conditions
• Evaluate sensors in a controlled laboratory 
exposure chamber
• Purpose
•
Evaluate sensors over a wider range of 
conditions that may be more difficult to 
capture in the field
•
Characterize certain performance 
parameters that are difficult to test in the 
field
Overview of Testing Protocols
Field measurements are most important for wildfire smoke because it’s challenging to 
generate realistic PM in the laboratory environment.
Controlled lab tests allow for better understanding of the PM characteristics or ambient 
conditions that may impact sensor performance in the field measurements.
1
• Field deployment of 3 or more identical air sensors with collocated Federal Reference 
Method or Federal Equivalent Method (FRM/FEM) monitors
• Testers have different options for field sites
• Set up their own FRM/FEM monitors at an outdoor, ambient site
• Establish collaborations with state/tribal/local agencies who manage existing air 
quality monitoring sites
• Collect measurements for at least 30 consecutive days

• The Performance Testing Protocols, Metrics, and Target Values Documents makes 
provisions for the need for future guidance for specific applications.
Wildfire smoke monitoring was called out specifically:
17
Guidance for Wildfire Smoke Applications
“For NSIM applications where high PM2.5 concentrations are expected 
(e.g., wildfire smoke applications), it is recommended that testers 
conduct base testing in more than two locations and include sites 
impacted by wildfire smoke and higher PM2.5 concentrations.”
Additional evaluations for 
smoke sensors
18
Evaluate at hour averages
• Higher time 
resolution data is 
needed during smoke 
events
• Precision at hourly 
averages is important
• Enables comparison 
across the network
Sensors are 
typically within 
a few µg/m3
Occasional 
issues occur
Example:
19
Corrections may be needed to improve 
performance
20
• Sensors may perform 
differently at different 
concentration levels
Nonlinearity between 
PurpleAir and Monitor 
PM2.5 ~>250 µg/m3
20
Collocations at multiple sites with multiple FEM and 
temporary monitor types across the U.S.
Corrections may be needed to improve 
performance
• Sensors may perform 
differently at different 
concentration levels
• Sensors with the 
same internal sensor 
may perform 
differently
RAMP and PurpleAir both contain Plantower PMS5003
•
Show different performance
•
Likely due to different internal correction algorithms
•
May vary with firmware version
Sensor performance evaluations in Research Triangle Park, NC
21
Evaluate over expanded concentration range
• Consider evaluation at each Air 
Quality Index (AQI) category or 
AQI breakpoint
• Evaluate at relevant 
occupational exposure limits
• e.g., Cal/OSHA: 500 µg/m3
(Source: https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/)
22
Evaluate in more locations seasonally
• Temperature, Relative Humidity, and 
local particle properties may 
influence sensor performance
• Need collocations in area where the 
sensors are used
• Scale with the size of the network
• Across climate regions for a national 
network
• Across a region for a regional network
• Across a city for a local network
• Collocations seasonal at a minimum
• Longer collocations (>1 year) may help 
understand drift and network aging

references/maps/us-climate-regions)
23
Quality control checks are essential
• Sensor failure may not be obvious (e.g., 
no longer reporting)
• Sensors exposed to high smoke 
concentrations may fail faster
• Frequently check data for failure modes
• Repeated concentration values or zeros
• Baseline shifts
• Unreasonable values
• Collocate again if possible
• Compare to nearby sensors or monitors 
if available

Sensor issue?
24
Consider the monitor type used for 
comparison
25
The Federal Reference Method 
(FRM) is the gold standard for 
accuracy, but samples are 
integrated over 24-hours and 
there is a lag-time due to 
laboratory analysis. 
The Federal Equivalent Methods 
(FEMs) provide automated data at 
higher time resolution (generally 
every hour). They are used across 
the official air monitoring 
network and were designated by 
comparison to FRMs under typical 
conditions (not smoke).
Temporary monitors also provide 
hourly data, were tested for 
performance under high 
concentrations, and are used 
extensively by government 
organizations for supplemental 
monitoring during wildland fire 
smoke events.
Higher time resolution comparisons provided by collocation with FEMs or temporary 
monitors are recommended for smoke evaluations.
Consider all FRM/FEM data available 
during collocation
• Many continuous Federal Equivalent 
Methods are not evaluated under extreme 
smoke conditions
• Bias or flow rate issues have been observed at 
high concentrations
• Ensure relative humidity and other quality 
control parameters are in range
• Collocate with multiple types of monitor so 
that not overly impacted by a single 
monitor
• Use comparability assessments with 
Federal Reference Methods (when 
available)

Quality control for monitors
• Smoke monitoring 
• ± 5% for set flow
• Ambient temperature < 45 °C
• Internal relative humidity
• < 50% for E-BAM
• < 45% for BAM
• Concentration < 5 mg/m3
27
• Air Quality System (AQS) 
monitoring
• FEM and FRM measurements
• Quality assurance and control 
are the responsibility of 
state/local/tribal air 
monitoring agency
• Follow specific guidelines:

• Ideally:
• Within target polygon
• Multiplicative bias (Slope) = 0.9 to 1.1
• Additive bias (Intercept)= -2 to 2

Recommendations Summary
• Evaluate 1-hr averages
• Corrections may be needed to improve performance
• Precision is important
• Evaluate up to 500 µg/m3 important for respirator use
• Need evaluations/collocations in areas where the sensors are used
• Collocate every season or more frequently if possible
• Federal Equivalent Methods and temporary smoke monitors may be 
used as “reference monitors” but they may also need additional 
quality control

Federal Reference Method
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
40
The Federal Reference Method (FRM) for PM2.5, to which other 
instruments are compared, measures in this way:
Particles are precisely size-
selected based on their 
inertial properties (how 
they move in an air flow)
Particles deposit to a 
filter at a known and 
controlled air flow 
rate (e.g., 16.7 lpm)
Filters are 
conditioned and 
weighed at a 
laboratory facility
This approach is the gold standard for accuracy, but slow in the data duration 
(24 hr samples), sometimes discontinuous (e.g., 1 in 3 days), and has a lag-
time due to laboratory analysis. 
Higher time resolution comparisons 
are recommended for smoke 
evaluations
40
Federal Equivalent Methods
41
To provide timely and automated PM2.5 data, Federal Equivalent Methods (FEMs) are used 
across the official U.S. air monitoring network.
The most common method:
1.
Particles are size-selected 
with a cyclone on the inlet
2.
Particles deposit to a filter 
tape inside the instrument 
3.
Particle mass is measured 
by beta-attenuation
4.
Outputs hourly data
The second most common method:
1.
Particles are size-selected with a 
cyclone on the inlet
2.
Particles pass through a 
polychromatic light – the 
scattered light from the particles 
is converted to a particle mass 
concentration through a 
proprietary algorithm
3.
Outputs hourly data (faster time 
resolution possible)
The FEM designation process requires field tests comparing to FRMs under typical USA concentrations (not wildfire 
smoke events)

Smoke Monitors
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
42
Two monitor types – E-BAMS and E-Samplers – are used extensively by 
government organizations for supplemental monitoring during wildland fire 
smoke events.
Measurement principle: 
E-BAM: beta-attenuation by particles deposited to a filter
E-Sampler: optical measurement of particles in an air stream
General traits:
-
Size selection inlet
-
Long history of use worldwide
-
Rugged design to support outdoor sampling in all weather conditions
-
Well-controlled flow rate
-
Self-diagnostic capability
