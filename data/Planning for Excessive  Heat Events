October 2007  
During an average 
summer, approximately 
1,500 people die from 
excessive heat events in 
the U.S.1 
 A single heat 
wave in Chicago killed 
more than 700 people 
in 1995. In Europe, 
a record heat wave 
claimed an estimated 
35,000 lives in 2003. In 
both cases, most of the 
 
victims were 65 or older. 
“It’s Too Darn Hot” – 
Planning for Excessive 
Heat Events 
Information for Older Adults and 
Family Caregivers 
D
id you know that each 
year more people die 
from “excessive heat 
events” than from 
hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, 
floods, and earthquakes combined?2 
Anyone can be adversely affected by 
excessive heat, but older adults are 
particularly vulnerable. 
Excessive heat events are prolonged 
periods when temperatures reach10 
degrees Fahrenheit or more above 
the average high temperature for 
a region.3 
Excessive heat events are believed 
to have a disproportionate public 
health impact in cities. One reason 
is that roads and buildings absorb 
the sun’s energy and contribute to 
the formation of “heat islands.” While 
rural areas cool off at night, cities 
retain this absorbed heat. As a result, 
urban residents get less nighttime 
relief from high temperatures. 
Fortunately, there are simple steps 
that older adults, their care-givers, 
and community leaders can take to 
decrease the impact of excessive 
heat events. 
Who is At Risk from 
Extreme Heat? 
Older adults, as well as young children, 
are at high risk from excessive heat 
events. For the growing number of 
aging Americans, the body’s cooling 
mechanisms may become impaired. 
Living alone or being confined to a 
bed and unable to care for one’s self 
further increases risk. 
Existing health conditions such as 
chronic illness, mental impairment, 
and obesity can also heighten an 
individual’s vulnerability. Persons 
taking certain medications are 
likewise susceptible. 
In addition, people who live on 
the top floors of buildings without 
air-conditioning are more likely 
to be exposed to excessive heat. 
Participating in strenuous outdoor 
activities and consuming alcohol 
during unusually hot weather likewise 
exacerbates heat-related health effects. 
“Excessive 
 heat 
 events” 
 are 
 surprisingly 
 deadly. 
 Vulnerable  
groups 
 like 
 older 
 adults 
 are 
 at 
 particularly 
 high 
 risk. 
The 
 good 
 news 
 is 
 that 
 there 
 are 
 simple 
 steps 
 
people 
 can 
 take 
 to 
 protect 
 themselves. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
How Can I Reduce Exposure 
to Excessive Heat? 
The best defense against excessive heat is 
prevention. Air-conditioning is one of the 
best protective factors against heat-related 
illness and death.4 Even a few hours a day in 
air conditioning can greatly reduce the risk. 
Electric fans may provide comfort, but when 
temperatures are in the high 90s fans do not 
prevent heat-related illness. 
During excessive heat events, the following 
prevention strategies can save lives: 
•  Visit air-conditioned buildings in your 
community if your home is not air-conditioned. 
These may include: senior centers, movie 
theaters, libraries, shopping malls, or 
designated “cooling centers.” 
•  Take a cool shower or bath.5 
•  Drink lots of fluids. Don’t wait until you are 
thirsty to drink. If a doctor limits your fluid 
intake, make sure to ask how much to drink 
when it’s hot. Avoid beverages containing 
caffeine, alcohol, or large amounts of sugar. 
These drinks cause dehydration. 
•  Ask your doctor or other health care provider if 
the medications you take could increase your 
susceptibility to heat-related illness. 
•  Wear lightweight, light-colored, and 
loose-fitting clothing. 
•  Visit at-risk individuals at least twice a day. 
Watch for signs of heat-related illness such as 
hot, dry skin, confusion, hallucinations, and 
aggression. 
•  Call 9-1-1 if medical attention is needed. 
How Does Excessive Heat 
Affect the Body? 
The body normally cools itself by increasing 
blood flow to the skin and perspiring. Heat-
related illness and mortality occur when 
the body’s temperature control system 
becomes overloaded. When this happens, 
perspiring may not be enough. High levels 
of humidity can make it even harder for the 
body to cool itself. 
How are Excessive Heat and 
Heat Stroke Related? 
Heat stroke is the most serious health 
effect of excessive heat events. It is the 
failure of the body’s temperature control 
system. When the body loses its ability 
to cool itself, core body temperature rises 
rapidly. As a result, heat stroke can cause 
severe and permanent damage to vital 
organs. 
Victims can be identified by skin that 
appears hot, dry, and red in color. Other 
warning signs are confusion, hallucinations, 
and aggression. If not treated immediately, 
heat stroke can result in permanent 
disability or death. The good news is that 
heat stroke can be prevented by taking the 
easy steps outlined on this page. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
What Can Your Local 
Government Do to Help? 
Local governments can play an important role in 
predicting and responding to excessive heat events. 
Two increasingly common strategies are heat alert 
systems and heat reduction measures. 
Heat Alert Systems 
Heat Health Watch-Warning Systems identify when 
a heat-related public health threat is likely. These 
systems use computer programs that analyze 
National Weather Service forecasts and other local 
data to predict dangerous conditions. Heat Health 
Watch-Warning Systems have been established in 
Philadelphia, Seattle, Chicago, St. Louis, and other 
cities in the U.S. and Europe. 
After a warning has been called, city health authorities 
communicate this information to older adults, their 
care-givers, and other at-risk groups. 
Assist the Homeless and Those With 
Mental Health Illness 
The following steps are “best-practices” that city 
officials can take to alert residents and provide direct 
assistance: 
•  Distribute media advisories 
•  Activate telephone hotlines 
•  Alert neighborhood volunteers, family 
members, and friends 
•  Provide air-conditioned buildings and 
offer transportation to these facilities 
•  Assist the homeless 
•  Work with local “area agencies on aging” 
to educate at-risk individuals 
Cities may also coordinate with local utilities to 
ensure that no customer’s electricity is turned off 
during a heat wave. 
What Cost-Effective Steps Can 
Communities Take to Cool the Air? 
Two steps that communities can take include using 
construction material that reflect the sun’s rays, and 
planting trees and vegetation to provide shade and 
natural cooling. Both strategies reduce the urban heat 
island effect – urban temperatures 2-10 degrees 
Fahrenheit hotter than surrounding rural areas – and 
may limit the frequency, duration, and magnitude of 
excessive heat events. 
Heat reduction strategies such as using reflective 
“cool roofs” and light-colored pavements, and 
planting shade trees, have numerous benefits. 
These measures: 
•  Lower ambient temperatures 
•  Slow heat-driven reaction that forms 
ozone air pollution 
•  Decrease energy consumption 
•  Improve comfort and livability
