Schools as Cleaner Air and Cooling Centers
Tips for Teachers
HOW TO TALK TO YOUR STUDENTS
As schools improve their buildings’ resilience to extreme 
heat and wildfire smoke events, school staff can share 
information with families and students to explain the 
risks these events can pose and ways to stay safe, both in 
school and at home. The following resources can be used 
to talk with students. Children’s activity books, curricula, 
interactive online tools, and school-wide programs are 
available and can be tailored to your needs. Information 
is constantly being updated and translated into more 
languages. Some key websites to check for the latest 
information include  www.heat.gov and https://www.
airnow.gov/wildfires/
As appropriate, share resources with students to increase 
understanding of the health impacts of heat and smoke, 
how to find local information, and how to protect 
themselves and their families. Teachers can work with 
others in the building – school nurse, counselor, other 
teachers, and facilities mangers – to ensure everyone 
understands the protocols and can support each other 
and students during these events. Teachers may also 
want to use quick reference guides to recognize signs and 
symptoms of heat-related illness.

Communities are facing the impacts of climate change, including severe health consequences from 
heat waves and wildfires. EPA launched a pilot project in 2021 called Schools as Community Cleaner 
Air and Cooling Centers to address the combined hazards of extreme heat and wildfire smoke with 
a focus on spaces that serve children. The goals of this project are to support practical strategies 
for safeguarding children in schools during heat and smoke events. Teachers can be champions for 
facility improvements and other actions to keep kids and staff safe during the school day. This fact 
sheet can help you take the first steps.

HEAT DAY CHECKLIST
	
☐
Coordinate with school nurse to review the signs and symptoms of 
heat related illness.
	
☐
Use window coverings such as closing the blinds or using shading 
devices/materials (such as foil) to reflect the sun out of the building.
	
☐
Dim the lights or use fewer lights. 
	
☐
Use ceiling fans or room fans to increase airspeeds in the classroom.
	
☐
Encourage students to wear appropriate clothing for forecasted hot 
days in the classroom.
	
☐
Increase the frequency of water breaks and/or encourage students to 
bring water bottles.
	
☐
Reduce the use of equipment that produces heat, such as projectors.
	
☐
Maintain low-energy activities such as stretching and recovery in 
lieu of strenuous exercise.
	
☐
Check air outlets with a flashlight to ensure that there are no major 
obstructions that could inadvertently limit airflow. If you see 
something, notify maintenance before taking corrective action.
	
☐
Check with the maintenance department before a forecasted heat 
wave day to see if you need to make any thermostat adjustments. 
There may be special initiatives by the maintenance department 
that involve the thermostat as noted below:
•	
Pre-Cooling: Setting the thermostat to a lower temperature to 
start at a lower temperature at the beginning of the day.
•	
Load Shedding: Setting the thermostat to a slightly higher 
temperature to reduce the electrical strain and cooling capacity 
strain on the building's systems.
	
☐
If there is air conditioning, ensure windows and exterior doors are 
closed.
•	
If the air conditioning system isn't keeping the room cool, 
check with maintenance before opening the windows. Open 
windows can bring in more hot air, stressing the system. It 
could also turn off the air conditioning system if there are 
automatic HVAC shut off sensors on the windows.
SMOKE DAY CHECKLIST
	
☐
Ensure windows and exterior doors remain closed.
	
☐
Check for any cracks or openings in the walls/windows/doors and 
notify maintenance. 
	
☐
Continue the use of the air conditioning and ventilation systems.
	
☐
Check with the maintenance department if portable filtration units 
should be used.
	
☐
Consider the use of a do-it-yourself air cleaner similar 
to one here: https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/
wildfires-and-indoor-air-quality-iaq
	
☐
Avoid activities that create more fine particles indoors such as:
•	
Spraying aerosol products
•	
Frying or broiling food
•	
Burning candles or incense and using other air 
fresheners, including plug-ins
•	
Vacuuming, unless the vacuum has a HEPA filter
•	
Dust-producing activities such as woodworking, laser 
cutting, additive/3D printing, etc. without source capture 
exhaust with appropriate filtration
	
☐
Avoid strenuous activities to limit smoke inhalation.
	
☐
If there are concerns about smoke within the classroom, children 
ages 2 years and older can wear respirators and masks. However, 
NIOSH Approved respirators do not come in suitable sizes for very 
young children. Refer to CDC Guidance on Wildfire Smoke and 
Children.
	
☐
Help students recognize stress and mental health effects of wildfire 
smoke exposure, especially during longer duration events.
