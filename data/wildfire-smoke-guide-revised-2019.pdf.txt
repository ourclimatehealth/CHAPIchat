ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The Wildfire Smoke Guide for Public Health 
Officials, first published in 2002, was developed in 
part as a result of a workshop held at the University 
of Washington in June 2001, under the auspices of 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 
X, and the Department of Environmental Health, 
School of Public Health and Community Medicine 
of the University of Washington. It was written 
by Harriet Ammann (Washington Department 
of Health); Robert Blaisdell and Michael Lipsett 
(California Office of Environmental Health Hazard 
Assessment), Susan Lyon Stone (U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency); and Shannon Therriault 
(Missoula, MT County Health Department), 
with input from individuals in several other state 
and federal agencies, in particular Jed Waldman 
(California Department of Health Services) and 
Peggy Jenkins (California Air Resources Board).
The 2008 version of this document was written by 
Michael Lipsett and Barbara Materna (California 
Department of Public Health); Susan Lyon 
Stone (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency); 
Shannon Therriault (Missoula, MT County Health 
Department); Robert Blaisdell (California Office 
of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment); and 
Jeff Cook (California Air Resources Board), with 
input from individuals in several other government 
agencies and academia.
The 2016 version of this document was updated 
by a team of experts from the same agencies that 
developed the current, 2019 version. The goal of the 
2016 revision was to quickly update the 2008 version 
by incorporating the expanded scientific evidence 
base, and then take more time expanding the Guide 
by adding new sections and fact sheets. Since 2016, 
eight factsheets have been developed, with links 
available in Appendix A. More will be coming, 
including translations of the currently available ones, 
so watch for them. 
This 2019 version of the Guide is the product 
of an inter-agency collaboration that includes: 
California Air Resources Board; California Office 
of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment; U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; U.S. 
Forest Service; and U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. Team members, authors, contributors and 
reviewers are listed below.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Wildfire smoke events can occur without warning 
– but we can be prepared. This Guide is intended
to provide state, tribal, and local public health
officials with information they need to be prepared
for smoke events and, when wildfire smoke is
present, to communicate health risks and take
measures to protect the public. Although developed
for public health officials, the information in this
document could be useful to many other groups
including health professionals, air quality officials,
and members of the public. The document is
divided into five Chapters and five Appendices.
Guide authors and contributors will post up-to-date
guidance, documents, and other new evidence-based
information here between revisions for use by public
health officials.
Health Effects of Wildfire Smoke
Wildfire smoke is a mixture of air pollutants of 
which particulate matter is the principal public 
health threat. The initial basis for understanding 
wildfire smoke health effects was derived primarily 
from studies of ambient air pollutants, specifically 
particulate matter. Extensive scientific evidence has 
demonstrated health effects in response to short-
term (i.e., daily) particulate matter exposure ranging 
from eye and respiratory tract irritation to more 
serious effects, including reduced lung function, 
pulmonary inflammation, bronchitis, exacerbation 
of asthma and other lung diseases, exacerbation of 
cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure, and 
even premature death. Recent studies examining the 
health effects of wildfire smoke provide evidence 
of health effects consistent with those reported for 
particulate matter. However, there is only limited 
evidence about the potential health impacts due 
to cumulative exposures from repeated, multi-day 
wildfire smoke exposures or multiple, consecutive 
fire seasons.
Although a large population can be exposed to 
smoke during a wildfire event, most healthy adults 
and children will recover quickly from wildfire 
smoke exposure. Certain lifestages and populations 
may, however, be at greater risk of experiencing 
health effects, including people with respiratory or 
cardiovascular diseases, children and older adults, 
pregnant women, people of lower socioeconomic 
status, and outdoor workers. 
Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality Impacts 
The science of wildfire behavior and management 
is complex and highly technical. Wildfire smoke 
produced from combustion of natural biomass 
contains thousands of individual compounds, 
including particulate matter, carbon dioxide, water 
vapor, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other 
organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and trace 
minerals. Wildfires can move into the wildland urban 
interface (WUI), burning homes and structures and 
thereby consuming man made materials in addition to 
natural fuels. More research is needed to understand 
potential health impacts of breathing this complex 
mix of natural and man made material emissions.
Wildfire behavior will vary depending on natural 
fuel type; fires in forest fuels can range from mild 
to severe and can spread very slowly or extremely 
rapidly depending on weather and fuel conditions. 
Wildfires in forests can last for weeks or months and 
are often the type that results in the most severe and 
longest duration air quality impacts. Smoke levels in 
populated areas can be difficult to predict. 
Most of the tens of thousands of wildfires in the 
United States are suppressed when they first start. 
Those that continue past the initial suppression 
attempt can become large, of long duration, and a 
significant source of smoke. On these types of fires, 
an Incident Management Team (IMT) is usually 
2
engaged, which is then guided by the land owner/
manager/agency administrator and pre-existing land 
management plans. 
Specific Strategies to Reduce Exposure 
to Wildfire Smoke
In areas where the public is experiencing wildfire 
smoke, public health and air quality agencies should 
provide advice on strategies to limit exposure, which 
include staying indoors; limiting physical activity; 
reducing indoor air pollution sources; effectively 
using air conditioners and air filters or cleaners; 
creating cleaner air shelters; and using respiratory 
protection appropriately.
The most common advisory during a smoke episode 
is to stay indoors, where people can better control 
their environment. Whether at home or in a public 
space, indoor environments that have filtered air 
and climate control can provide relief from smoke 
and heat. High-efficiency heating, ventilation, and 
air-conditioning (HVAC) filters (rated MERV 13 or 
higher) in systems that can accommodate them can 
help reduce particle concentrations indoors.
Appropriately sized room air cleaners can also reduce 
particle concentrations in individual rooms. It is 
important to choose a room air cleaner that produces 
little or no ozone. The California Air Resources 
Board provides a list of air cleaners that meet the 
ozone emissions limit. High-efficiency filters and 
room air cleaners are more effective with more 
frequent operation. Individuals can use a room air 
cleaner in a designated room in the house to create 
a protected environment called a “clean room” at 
home. Public cleaner-air shelters and spaces can 
provide relief from smoke for individuals who do 
not have adequate air filtration or cooling equipment 
at home. When traveling between indoor locations 
with cleaner air, people can reduce particle levels in 
vehicles by keeping windows and vents closed and 
operating the air conditioning in “recirculate” mode. 
Properly wearing a NIOSH-certified N95 or P100 
particulate respirator that fits closely to the face can 
help reduce personal exposure to wildfire smoke and 
ash. Adults who must remain outdoors in unhealthy 
air for extended periods due to work or other factors 
may particularly benefit from using this strategy. 
People should avoid using masks that do not provide 
proper protection, such as single-strap dust masks 
or surgical masks. Respirators are not made to fit 
children and will not protect them from breathing 
wildfire smoke.
Smoke levels can vary throughout the day, so people 
may be able to plan necessary trips outside during 
times when the air is less smoky or minimize their 
time in smoke impacted areas. Smoke outreach and 
forecasting tools can help people make decisions 
about when and where they can go to minimize their 
smoke exposures. When smoke levels are especially 
high, local officials may take actions such as closing 
schools or canceling public events. Where evacuation 
is necessary because of fire danger, public health 
officials should consider appropriate strategies to 
reduce smoke exposure during the evacuation, at 
evacuation centers, and after allowing evacuees to 
return home. 
Communicating Air Quality Conditions 
during Smoke Events 
The goal of air quality monitoring during a wildfire 
smoke event is to relay information to the public in 
a timely manner so people can make decisions about 
how to protect their health. Tools for measuring and 
estimating air quality conditions and conveying them 
to the public include the Air Quality Index (AQI; 
available on AirNow), visual range scale, or other 
approaches. The Current Conditions Map provides 
a one-stop place for the public on current wildfire 
and air quality information. School-focused guidance 
addresses outdoor activities, and the Air Quality 
Flag Program uses a visual flag alert for schools 
and organizations to take health protective actions. 
When requested by the land manager responding 
to a large wildfire, the Interagency Wildland Fire 
3
Air Quality Response Program will deploy an Air 
Resource Advisor (ARA) to the IMT. These technical 
specialists are trained to monitor air quality, analyze 
smoke impacts, model future smoke impacts, and 
provide smoke outlooks for impacted communities 
which will help public health officials in advising the 
public. 
Areas without continuous PM monitors may be able 
to get temporary, portable monitors through their 
federal, state, tribal, or local air quality agencies or 
the U.S. Forest Service, especially when associated 
with a wildfire incident with an assigned ARA. 
Emerging technology has expanded sources for air 
quality information, including miniaturized PM2.5 
sensors, mobile air quality monitoring systems, and 
data fusion products. However, there are many 
unknowns regarding their precision, accuracy, and 
reliability, especially under wildfire conditions. 
Therefore, sensor data and data fusion products 
should be considered supplemental information, but 
they need to be put into context with the help of 
nearby regulatory monitors or short-term monitors, 
AQI estimates, satellite data, and daily ARA Smoke 
Outlooks.
Recommendations for Public 
Health Actions
Communications planning for recommendations 
should address not only messages and actions during 
a wildfire event, but preparations to make before fires 
occur and as well as guidance for cleaning up after 
a fire. Many factors must be considered, so these 
recommendations should be adapted to each specific 
situation. Areas with established air quality programs 
typically have a communication plan for wildfire 
smoke events. One approach used by states and most 
communities across the country is to refer the public 
to the AirNow website (www.airnow.gov). 
In areas where fires are likely to occur, state and 
local public health agencies should consider 
running pre-season PSAs or news and social media 
announcements to advise the public on preparing 
for the fire season. During smoke periods, public 
advisories based on air quality levels should address 
special needs of at-risk lifestages and populations (in 
the Air Quality Index, the term “sensitive groups” 
is used), including people with heart or lung disease, 
older adults, children, pregnant women, and people 
of lower SES. Other concerns include advisories 
for outdoor workers, prolonged smoke events, and 
protections for pets and livestock.
Preparation is key. Recommendations to the 
public at risk for smoke exposure include advising 
preparations in advance of wildfire season, e.g. 
maintaining nonperishable groceries not requiring 
cooking. People with chronic diseases should check 
with their health care provider about precautions 
ahead of smoke events and have an adequate supply 
of medication available; asthmatics should have a 
written asthma action plan.
Recommended steps for public health officials 
to take before fires start include: check fire risk 
in monthly outlooks at National Interagency Fire 
Center (NIFC) website and, especially if high, 
communicate risk to the public; consider how 
to implement the recommended actions in the 
Guide; prepare a communication plan; and form 
partnerships with important partners or stakeholders 
(e.g., air quality agencies, local health providers, the 
media).
Even after the worst of the fire and smoke is over, 
exposure to lingering smoke and ash from a wildfire 
can cause significant health effects in both healthy 
and at-risk populations, such as respiratory irritation, 
heat-related illness and emotional stress, as well as 
physical stress or injuries from cleanup activities. In 
post-fire situations in which air quality is poor due to 
smoke and ash residue in or near affected structures, 
ventilation and other protective measures are advised 
during cleanup.

I. HEALTH EFFECTS
OF WILDFIRE SMOKE
Wildfires expose populations to multiple 
environmental hazards, from combustion 
due to the fire itself to air pollution from 
smoke and byproducts of combustion 
such as ash. In addition, when wildfires 
move into communities, chemicals 
in plastics and other chemicals can 
be released into the air from burning 
structures and furnishings. Wildfires 
also cause mental health concerns 
and psychological stress. Recently, 
epidemiological (e.g., Reid et al. 2016, 
Tinling et al. 2016, Wettstein et al. 2018) 
and toxicological (e.g., Kim et al. 2018) 
studies have focused broadly on the 
health effects of wildfire smoke exposure 
and the toxicity of specific fuel sources, 
respectively. These studies consistently 
demonstrate a variety of respiratory-
related health effects with more recent studies also 
providing some evidence of cardiovascular-related 
health effects in response to short-term (i.e., daily) 
wildfire smoke exposures. Although the body of 
literature specifically examining the health effects 
attributed to wildfire smoke exposure has grown, the 
initial understanding of potential health effects was 
derived from studies focusing on components of 
ambient air pollution, primarily in urban settings, that 
are also found in wildfire smoke (e.g., fine particulate 
matter and carbon monoxide). 
Particulate matter is the principal public health 
threat from short-and longer-term exposure to 
wildfire smoke and is the focus of most of this 
document. While particles from wildfire smoke can 
vary in size (see Section II. Wildfire Smoke and 
Air Quality Impacts), approximately 90% of total 
particle mass emitted from wildfires consists of fine 
particles (i.e., PM2.5, particles 2.5 µm in diameter or 
smaller) (Vicente et al. 2013; Groβ et al. 2013). The 
scientific evidence does not indicate that particles 
generated from wildfire smoke are more, or less, 
toxic than particles emitted from other sources 
(U.S. EPA 2009; DeFlorio-Barker et al. 2019). The 
effects of particulate matter exposure range from 
eye and respiratory tract irritation to more serious 
disorders including reduced lung function, bronchitis, 
exacerbation of asthma, heart failure, and premature 
death. Short-term exposures (i.e., days to weeks) 
to fine particles, a major component of smoke, are 
associated with increased risk of premature mortality 
and aggravation of pre-existing respiratory and 
cardiovascular disease. In addition, fine particles 
are respiratory irritants, and exposures to high 
concentrations can cause persistent cough, phlegm, 
wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Exposures to 
fine particles can also affect healthy people, causing 
respiratory symptoms, transient reductions in lung 
function, and pulmonary inflammation. Particulate 
matter may also affect the body’s ability to remove 
inhaled foreign materials, such as pollen and bacteria, 
from the lungs. Specific lifestages and populations 
may potentially be at increased risk of health effects 
5
due to particulate matter exposure (see next section) 
and actions should be taken to reduce their exposure 
to wildfire smoke. 
Ground-level ozone, though less of a concern from 
wildfires than particulate matter, can cause effects 
such as reductions in lung function, inflammation 
of the airways, chest pain, coughing, wheezing, 
and shortness of breath – even in healthy people. 
These effects can be more serious in people with 
asthma and other lung diseases. Respiratory effects 
attributed to ozone exposure can lead to increased 
use of medication, school absences, respiratory-
related hospital admissions, and emergency room 
visits for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). Although the evidence of ozone’s 
effects on the cardiovascular system (the heart, 
blood, and blood vessels) is more limited than the 
evidence of effects on the respiratory system, it 
indicates that short-term exposure to ozone may 
cause effects such as changes in heart rate variability 
and systemic inflammation. Additionally, evidence 
indicates that short-term ozone exposures can lead 
to premature mortality, as demonstrated by recent 
epidemiologic studies that consistently report positive 
associations between short-term ozone exposures 
and total non-accidental mortality, which includes 
deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes 
(U.S. EPA, 2013). 
Carbon monoxide is also present in wildfire smoke. 
Typically, exposures to carbon monoxide from 
wildfire smoke do not pose a significant hazard to 
the public, except to some at-risk populations and 
firefighters very close to the fire line. This is because 
carbon monoxide does not travel far from the 
point of combustion. Carbon monoxide enters the 
bloodstream through the lungs and reduces oxygen 
delivery to the body’s organs and tissues. People 
with cardiovascular disease may experience health 
effects such as chest pain or cardiac arrhythmias 
from lower levels of carbon monoxide than healthy 
people. At higher levels (such as those that occur in 
major structural fires), carbon monoxide exposure 
can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, 
nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma, and 
death, even in otherwise healthy individuals.
Wildfire smoke also contains significant quantities 
of respiratory irritants that can act in concert to 
produce eye and respiratory irritation and potentially 
exacerbate asthma. Additionally, Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (HAPs) (also referred to as Toxic 
Air Contaminants [TACs] by the California 
Environmental Protection Agency [CalEPA]) are also 
present in wildfire smoke (Reinhardt and Ottmar, 
2010). HAPs may contribute to adverse health 
effects in infants, children, pregnant women and 
their fetuses, elderly persons, those with existing 
lung, heart, or liver diseases, and persons engaging 
in physical activity. Among the extensive list of 
HAPs, acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde and 
benzene, are of concern because of their differential 
impact on infants and children compared to adults. 
These HAPs overall contribute to the cumulative 
irritant properties of smoke and are present in 
concentrations that may be above regulatory health 
guidance values (e.g. OEHHA Reference Exposure 
Levels and U.S. EPA Reference Concentrations). 
While most of the focus on health effects of wildfire 
smoke is on those attributed to short-term exposures 
(i.e. over a few days to weeks), it is also important to 
consider the health effects people may experience 
from cumulative exposures, whether due to repeated, 
multi-day exposures or multiple consecutive fire 
seasons. For example, there is concern that long-term 
exposures to chemicals in wildfire smoke at sufficient 
concentrations and durations might be a contributor 
to overall lifetime risk for heart disease, lung disease, 
and cancer. Unfortunately, there is little information 
on potential health effects from these types of 
exposures. The limited number of epidemiologic 
studies that have specifically examined the cumulative 
effect of wildfire smoke exposure on health have 
been studies of wildland firefighters. There is initial 
evidence that continuous occupational wildland fire 
smoke exposure (i.e., over multiple days) may have a 
cumulative effect on lung function, with some studies 
observing a progressive decline during burn seasons. 
However, it is unclear if this decline persists across 
off-seasons and it is difficult to compare a wildland 
6
firefighter’s occupational exposure and resulting 
health effects to those experienced by the general 
population (Adetona et al. 2016). 
Overall, it is important to recognize that not 
everyone who is exposed to smoke from wildfires 
will experience health effects. The level and 
duration of exposure, age, individual susceptibility, 
including the presence or absence of pre-existing 
lung (e.g., asthma, COPD) or heart disease, and 
other factors play significant roles in determining 
whether someone will experience smoke-related 
health problems.
At-risk lifestages and populations
Most healthy adults and children will recover quickly 
from smoke exposure and will not experience long-
term health consequences. However, certain at-risk 
lifestages and populations may be at greater risk of 
experiencing severe acute and chronic symptoms 
(See Chapter 5 for strategies to reduce exposure for 
at-risk lifestages and populations). Key risk factors 
that shape whether a population or individual is at 
increased risk of health effects from wildfire smoke 
have been identified primarily from epidemiologic 
studies examining exposure to fine particulate matter 
in urban settings. These studies provide evidence 
indicating the risk of health effects due to fine 
particulate exposures can vary based on lifestage 
(i.e., children, < 18 years of age; and older adults, ≥ 
65 years of age), health status, and socioeconomic 
status. However, studies suggest that the health 
effects due to wildfire smoke exposure are likely to be 
similar to those of urban particle pollution (Adetona 
et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2015, Naeher et al. 2007, Reid et 
al. 2016). 
It appears that the risk of fine particle-related health 
effects varies throughout a lifetime, generally being 
higher during early childhood, lower in healthy 
adolescents and younger adults, and increasing 
during middle age through old age as the incidence 
of heart and lung disease, hypertension, and diabetes 
increases. Therefore, certain lifestages (e.g., children) 
and populations (e.g., people with pre-existing 
respiratory and cardiovascular disease) should be 
particularly diligent about taking precautions to limit 
exposure to wildfire smoke. The following sections 
provide more specific information on subsets of 
the population that may be differentially affected by 
exposure to wildfire smoke.
While the focus of this section is on those groups 
at greatest risk of experiencing health effects from 
exposure to fine particles, as noted previously, 
pollutants emitted from wildfires can undergo 
atmospheric reactions and form secondary pollutants, 
such as ozone. Some of the same groups that 
are at increased risk of health effects due to fine 
particles are also at increased risk of health effects 
from exposure to ozone. This includes people 
with asthma and other lung diseases, children, 
older adults, and people who are active outdoors 
(e.g., outdoor workers). 
Therefore, the lifestages and population groups 
considered as being at greatest risk of a health effect 
from exposure to fine particles and ozone should 
be aware of the potential effect of these pollutants 
on their health during wildfire events by checking 
the Air Quality Index (AQI) forecast each day and 
following recommendations to reduce fine particle 
and ozone exposure. 
People with asthma and other respiratory diseases. 
More than 25 million people in the United States, 
including more than 6 million children, experience 
chronic lung diseases such as asthma with another 
16 million experiencing COPD (CDC 2017, CDC 
2018). Air pollution, such as wildfire smoke, can lead 
to breathing difficulties for people with chronic lung 
diseases, such as asthma and COPD, and potentially 
trigger exacerbations of their disease. Extensive 
evidence from epidemiologic studies focusing on 
exposure to fine particles demonstrates increased 
risk of emergency department visits and hospital 
admissions for asthma and COPD (U.S. EPA, 2009).
Asthma is a condition characterized by chronic 
inflammation of the bronchi and smaller airways, 
with intermittent airway constriction, causing 
7
shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and 
coughing, sometimes accompanied by excess mucus 
production. During an asthma attack, the muscles 
tighten around the airways and the lining of the 
airways becomes inflamed and swollen, constricting 
the free flow of air. Because children’s airways are 
narrower than those of adults, irritation, such as from 
wildfire smoke, that might create minor problems 
for an adult may result in significant obstruction in 
the airways of a young child. Additionally, minority 
and impoverished children and adults bear a 
disproportionate burden associated with asthma and 
other diseases, which may increase their susceptibility 
to the health effects of wildfire smoke (Brim et al. 
2008, CDC 2014). However, these diseases affect all 
age and sociodemographic groups.
A significant fraction of the population may 
have airway hyper responsiveness; an exaggerated 
tendency of the large and small airways (bronchi and 
bronchioles, respectively) to constrict in response to 
respiratory irritants including cold air, dry air, and 
other stimuli, including wildfire smoke. While airway 
hyper responsiveness is considered a hallmark of 
asthma, this tendency may also be found in many 
individuals without asthma for example, during 
and following a lower respiratory tract infection. In 
such individuals, wildfire smoke exposure may cause 
asthma-like symptoms.
Individuals with COPD -- generally considered to 
encompass emphysema and chronic bronchitis -- 
may also experience worsening of their conditions 
because of exposure to wildfire smoke. Patients with 
COPD often have an asthmatic component to their 
condition, which may result in their experiencing 
asthma-like symptoms. However, because their lung 
capacity has typically been seriously compromised, 
additional constriction of the airways in individuals 
with COPD may result in symptoms requiring 
medical attention. Researchers have reported that 
individuals with COPD run an increased risk of 
requiring emergency medical care after exposure to 
particulate matter or wildfire smoke. In addition, 
because COPD is usually the result of many years 
of smoking, individuals with this condition may also 
have heart and vascular disease and are potentially at 
risk of health effects due to wildfire smoke exposure 
from both conditions.
People with cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular 
diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the 
United States, comprising approximately 30 to 40 
percent of all deaths each year (Xu et al. 2018). 
Most of these deaths occur in people over 65 years 
of age. Diseases of the circulatory system (e.g., 
high blood pressure, heart failure, vascular diseases 
such as coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular 
conditions) can put individuals at increased risk 
of cardiovascular-related events triggered by 
air pollutants. 
Following exposure to particulate matter, people with 
chronic heart disease may experience one or more 
of the following symptoms: palpitations, unusual 
fatigue, or lightheadedness; shortness of breath, 
chest tightness, pain in the chest, neck, or shoulder. 
Chemical messengers released into the blood because 
of particle-related lung inflammation may increase 
the risk of blood clot formation, angina episodes, 
heart attacks, and strokes. Studies have linked fine 
particulate matter to increased risks of heart attacks, 
and sudden death from cardiac arrhythmia, heart 
failure, or stroke (U.S. EPA, 2009). Despite this 
evidence regarding fine particulate matter effects and 
cardiovascular effects, wildfire-related cardiovascular 
studies have been inconsistent, although several 
recent investigations have identified elevated risks 
of specific health outcomes (Wettstein et al. 2018, 
Deflorio-Barker et al. 2019). 
Children. All children, even those without 
pre-existing illnesses or chronic conditions, are 
considered at-risk of experiencing a health effect due 
to air pollution, including wildfire smoke. Compared 
to adults, children spend more time outside, tend to 
engage in more vigorous activity, and inhale more 
air (and therefore more smoke constituents) per 
pound of body weight — all of which can affect 
the developing lungs (Sacks et al. 2011). For these 
reasons, it is important to try to limit children’s 
vigorous outdoor activities during wildfire events. 
Although the focus of this document is wildfire 
8
smoke, children may encounter other environmental 
hazards including air pollutants from burning 
structures and furnishings, and exposure to fire ash if 
children are present during fire clean up. 
Wildfire smoke can persist for days or even months, 
depending on the extent of the wildfire. Symptoms 
of wildfire smoke inhalation, which can include 
coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and 
chest tightness, are supported by evidence from 
epidemiologic studies of particulate matter that 
report increased respiratory symptoms and decreased 
lung function (U.S. EPA, 2009). Air pollution 
from wildfires can exacerbate asthma symptoms 
and trigger attacks. Research has shown a higher 
rate of asthma emergency department visits and 
hospital admissions for children, especially infants 
and very young children, during and after wildfires 
(Hutchinson et al., 2007). Even children without 
asthma could experience respiratory symptoms, 
resulting in school absences and other limitations of 
normal childhood activities.
In addition to the overt health effects and underlying 
physiologic differences between children and adults, 
children may also experience significant emotional 
distress, resulting from anxiety and grief following 
a wildfire. It is important to consider not only the 
potential physical health implications of wildfire 
smoke on children, but also the potential longer-term 
psychological implications. 
See factsheet Protecting Children from Wildfire 
Smoke and Ash.
Pregnant women. During pregnancy, physiologic 
changes, such as higher respiratory rates and 
increases in blood and plasma volumes, increase a 
woman’s vulnerability to environmental exposures. 
Additionally, during critical windows of human 
development, a mother’s exposure to wildfire smoke 
may harm the developing fetus. A few studies have 
examined potential health effects of wildfire smoke 
exposure during pregnancy. Holstius et al. (2012) 
examined the effect of wildfire smoke on pregnancy 
outcomes in Southern California and reported some 
evidence indicating a potential reduction in birth 
weight due to in utero exposure to wildfire smoke. In 
addition, psychosocial stress exacerbated by wildfires 
is another mechanism through which wildfire events 
may affect the health of pregnant women and their 
fetuses (Kumagai et al. 2004). While there are few 
studies examining the health effects of exposure 
to wildfire smoke on pregnancy outcomes, there 
is some available evidence of health effects due to 
exposures to other combustion-related air pollutants. 
Specifically, there is substantial evidence of low birth 
weight due to repeated exposures to cigarette smoke, 
including both active and passive smoking and an 
emerging, but still inconsistent body of literature on 
the health effects of prenatal exposure to ambient 
air pollution. Specifically, studies examining chronic 
maternal exposure to ambient particulate matter (U.S. 
EPA 2009) and indoor biomass smoke (e.g., Amegah 
et al. 2014) from wood-fired home heating devices 
have provided some evidence of adverse birth and 
obstetrical outcomes (e.g., decreased infant birth 
weight, preterm birth).
Older adults. The number of U.S. adults 65 years 
of age and older will nearly double between 2012 
and 2050 (Ortman et al. 2014). Older adults are 
at increased risk of health effects from short-
term exposures to wildfire smoke because of 
their higher prevalence of pre-existing lung and 
heart diseases, and because important physiologic 
processes, including defense mechanisms, decline 
with age. Epidemiologic studies of short-term 
exposures to fine particles have reported greater 
risks of emergency department visits and hospital 
admissions and mortality, in older adults (U.S. EPA, 
2009). Additional evidence from animal toxicological 
studies and human clinical studies provides biological 
plausibility and further support that older adults 
should limit exposures to fine particle pollution, such 
as wildfire smoke.
9
Low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is often 
defined in epidemiologic studies using a variety of 
indicators such as educational attainment, median 
household income, percentage of the population in 
poverty, race/ethnicity, and location of residence. It 
is well-recognized that SES is a composite measure 
that encompasses multiple individual indicators 
along with other factors and is often measured at 
the population- or community-level. Epidemiologic 
studies of fine particulate matter using indicators 
of SES provide initial evidence that individuals of 
low SES may be at increased risk of mortality due 
to short-term exposures. With respect to wildfire 
smoke the evidence is much more limited, although 
Rappold et al. (2012) and Reid et al. (2016) reported 
some evidence that locations classified as having the 
lowest SES were at the greatest risk of health effects 
attributed to wildfire smoke. 
In addition, SES may contribute to differential 
exposures to wildfire smoke across communities. 
For example, access to air conditioning reduces 
infiltration of particle pollution indoors. Less access 
to air conditioning may lead to greater exposure to 
wildfire smoke and greater sensitivity to extreme 
heat and, subsequently, health disparities across 
communities. People of color and impoverished 
children and adults bear a disproportionate burden 
of asthma and other respiratory diseases and 
therefore they may be at increased risk of health 
effects due to wildfire smoke exposure (Brim et al. 
2008, CDC 2014). As a result, additional outreach 
activities and support may be required to properly 
communicate the actions that people of low SES 
should take to both reduce and protect themselves 
from wildfire smoke exposures.
Outdoor workers. Working outdoors during periods 
of wildfire smoke exposure could result in a range 
of health effects depending on the underlying health 
status of the worker. Effects of exposure to wildfire 
smoke range from eye and respiratory tract irritation 
to the triggering of an asthma exacerbation or 
cardiovascular event. For workers that encompass a 
previously identified at-risk population or lifestage, 
and workers who are negatively impacted by smoke 
exposure, some of the same recommendations 
listed in this document for the general public apply 
when working outdoors in a smoky environment. 
See Chapter 5 (Protecting Outdoor Workers) for 
more information.
Summary
Particulate matter is the principal public health 
threat from exposure to wildfire smoke. The 
effects of particulate matter exposure range from 
eye and respiratory tract irritation to more serious 
disorders including reduced lung function, bronchitis, 
exacerbation of asthma and heart failure, and even 
premature death. Although exposure to fine particles 
can lead to a range of health effects, certain lifestages 
and populations are at greatest risk of health effects 
due to fine particle exposures (Table 1). While 
evidence about the implications of repeated or 
prolonged smoke exposures on health is very limited, 
when smoke exposure is expected to be prolonged, 
public health officials should consider all options in 
communicating the importance of actions that can 
be taken to reduce smoke exposure.

Lifestage/
Population
Rationale and Potential Health Effects from Wildfire Smoke Exposure
People with asthma 
and other respiratory 
diseases
Rationale: Underlying respiratory diseases result in compromised health status that can result in the triggering of 
severe respiratory responses by environmental irritants, such as wildfire smoke. 
Potential health effects: Breathing difficulties (e.g., coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness) and exacerbations of 
chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma and COPD) leading to increased medication usage, emergency department visits, 
and hospital admissions. 
People with 
cardiovascular disease
Rationale: Underlying circulatory diseases result in compromised health status that can result in the triggering of 
severe cardiovascular events by environmental irritants, such as wildfire smoke.
Potential health effects: Triggering of ischemic events, such as angina pectoris, heart attacks, and stroke; worsening of 
heart failure; or abnormal heart rhythms could lead to emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and even 
death. 
Children
Rationale: Children’s lungs are still developing and there is a greater likelihood of increased exposure to wildfire 
smoke resulting from more time spent outdoors, engagement in more vigorous activity, and inhalation of more air 
per pound of body weight compared to adults.
Potential health effects: Coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, decreased lung function in all 
children. In children with asthma, worsening of asthma symptoms or heightened risk of asthma attacks may occur.
Pregnant women
Rationale: Pregnancy-related physiologic changes (e.g., increased breathing rates) may increase vulnerability to 
environmental exposures, such as wildfire smoke. In addition, during critical development periods, the fetus may 
experience increased vulnerability to these exposures.
Potential health effects: Limited evidence shows air pollution-related effects on pregnant women and the developing 
fetus, including low birth weight and preterm birth. 
Older adults
Rationale: Higher prevalence of pre-existing lung and heart disease and decline of physiologic process, such as 
defense mechanisms. 
Potential health effects: Exacerbation of heart and lung diseases leading to emergency department visits, hospital 
admissions, and even death.
People of low 
socioeconomic status
Rationale: Less access to health care could lead to higher likelihood of untreated or insufficient treatment 
of underlying health conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes). Less access to measures to reduce exposure (e.g., air 
conditioning) could lead to higher levels of exposure to wildfire smoke. 
Potential health effects: Greater exposure to wildfire smoke due to less access to measures to reduce exposure, 
along with higher likelihood of untreated or insufficiently treated health conditions could lead to increased risks of 
experiencing the health effects described above. 
Outdoor workers
Rationale: Extended periods of time exposed to high concentrations of wildfire smoke. 
Potential health effects: Greater exposure to wildfire smoke can lead to increased risks of experiencing the range of 
health effects described above.

II. WILDFIRE SMOKE AND
AIR QUALITY IMPACTS
12
Composition of wildfire smoke
Smoke from combustion of natural biomass is 
a complex mixture of particulate matter, carbon 
dioxide, water vapor, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons 
and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and 
trace minerals. The individual compounds present 
in smoke number in the thousands. Most research 
on wildland fire emissions has centered on natural 
biomass fuels—the vegetative materials comprised 
of trees, needles, leaves, branches, litter, duff, stumps, 
grasses, shrubs, and downed trees. Wildfires may also 
move into the WUI burning homes and structures in 
the process and thus consuming man made materials 
in addition to natural fuels. More research is needed 
to understand potential health impacts of breathing 
this complex mix of natural and man made material 
emissions.     
The Clean Air Act requires EPA to set National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 
pollutants considered harmful to public health 
and the environment. EPA has set NAAQS for six 
principal pollutants, including three pollutants that 
may be of concern during wildfire smoke events: 
particulate matter (regulated in two size categories: 
PM10 and PM2.5), ground level ozone (O3), and 
carbon monoxide (CO).
In wildfire smoke, particulate matter, especially the 
smallest size component PM2.5, is the principal air 
pollutant of concern for public health. Particulate 
matter is a generic term for particles suspended in 
the air, typically as a mixture of both solid particles 
and liquid droplets. The size of the particles (Figure 
1) affects their potential to cause health effects.
Particles larger than 10 micrometers in diameter do
not usually reach the lungs though they can irritate
the eyes, nose, and throat. Particles with diameters
less than 10 micrometers (PM10) can be inhaled
into the lungs and affect the lungs, heart, and blood
vessels. The smallest particles, those less than 2.5
micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are the greatest risk
to public health because they can reach deep into the
lungs and may even make it into the bloodstream.
Most of the effort to quantify, describe, and monitor
smoke and health effects from wildfires focuses on
Figure 1. Fine, inhalable particulate matter (PM2.5) is the 
air pollutant of greatest concern to public health from 
wildfire smoke because it can travel deep into the lungs 
and may even enter the bloodstream.
PM2.5. Particles from smoke tend to be very small, 
with a size range near the wavelength of visible 
light (0.4–0.7 micrometers), and therefore efficiently 
scatter light and impact visibility, which can pose 
a serious safety risk when smoke crosses roads or 
impacts airports.  
Two other pollutants that may be of concern during 
wildfire smoke events are carbon monoxide and 
ozone. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless 
gas produced by incomplete combustion of wood 
or other organic materials. Carbon monoxide dilutes 
rapidly so is rarely a concern for the general public, 
or people with heart disease who are at-greater 
risk from exposure, unless they are in very close 
proximity to the wildfire (generally within three 
miles of the fire line and when smoldering fuels 
are present). Carbon monoxide can be a concern 
to firefighters close to the fire line. Smoke episodes 
can also be associated with elevated levels of ozone. 
Ozone is not emitted directly from a wildfire but 
forms in the plume as smoke moves downwind. It 
can be further enhanced if given the opportunity to 
mix with urban sources of nitrous oxides. Note that 
ozone is not always enhanced downwind of a fire as 
the formation and breakdown of ozone is a complex 
photo-chemical process.
13
Many other chemicals are present in wildfire smoke 
but at much lower concentrations than particulate 
matter, ozone, and carbon monoxide. These include 
an extensive list of HAPs that can be potent 
respiratory irritants and carcinogens.  Given that 
the specific effects of these pollutants are hard 
to quantify and measure during an active smoke 
incident, PM2.5 is typically the pollutant that is tracked 
and monitored, and the pollutant that is used to 
estimate public health effects from wildfire smoke
Characteristics of wildfires 
Wildfires need three conditions to start—fuel, 
oxygen and a heat source—these three together are 
known as the fire triangle. Fuel is anything that can 
burn such as grass, brush, trees and even homes and 
other structures. The more fuel there is to burn, the 
more intense a fire can be. Fire needs oxygen to grow 
and winds increase oxygen supply and fire intensity. 
Plus, winds can push heat from the fire into new 
areas, preheating and drying fuels and moving the fire 
rapidly forward. Heat sources spark the fire and bring 
fuel temperatures hot enough to ignite and burn. The 
sun, lightning, burning campfires, cigarettes, sparks, 
and hot winds are all examples of heat sources 
Figure 2. Wildfire rate of spread, fuel consumed, smoke produced, and duration are all influenced by vegetation 
type. Fires in grass fuels tend to spread quickly and burn out quickly. Fires in brush fuel types can burn hot 
and spread fast if weather conditions are right. Fires in forest fuel types can range from slow moving to rapidly 
spreading; long lasting fires in this fuel type tend to produce the most serious and prolonged smoke impacts but 
smoke can cause problems from wildfires in all fuel types.
14
necessary to start and promote growth of wildfires. 
Once ignited, fuels, weather. and topography govern 
fire behavior and determine how fast the fire spreads, 
how intensely it burns, and how much smoke it will 
put into the air on a given day. The changing climate 
is also influencing the frequency, duration, and 
severity of wildfires due to a warming climate, longer 
fire seasons, and increases in drought conditions 
(Westerling et al. 2003; USGCRP 2018). 
Wildland fuels
The general characteristics of wildland fuels help 
predict some of what will happen during a wildfire 
smoke incident. Very generally, natural fuel fires can 
be described in three large and diverse categories: 
grass, brush, and forest (Figure 2). Wildfires in 
grass typically spread very rapidly but generally 
burn themselves out and are brought under control 
within hours to days of ignition. Brush-type fuels, 
for example chaparral, gallberry, and ceanothus 
often contain volatile compounds that result in hot, 
fast moving fires that are very difficult to control 
Figure 3. Strong winds can cause rapid fire spread and move smoke into communities far from a wildfire. In 2018, 
smoke from the Camp fire caused weeks of poor air quality in the San Francisco Bay area (a). Light winds and 
stable atmospheric conditions cause smoke to pool near a wildfire and flow down valleys to nearby communities as 
seen in central Idaho in 2012 (b).
especially if the brush is growing on slopes or in 
dense clusters. Wildfires in forest fuel types can range 
from mild to severe in intensity and can spread very 
slowly or extremely rapidly depending on weather 
and fuel conditions. Fires in forests can last for 
weeks or months and are often the wildfire type that 
results in the most severe and longest duration air 
quality impacts. Fires in forest fuel types are more 
likely to be in remote and inaccessible areas making 
firefighting more difficult. Wildfires of course often 
burn over multiple fuel types and may start in one 
fuel type before moving into another. 
The amount and type of fuel and its moisture 
content affect smoke production, as does the stage 
of combustion (flaming and smoldering). The 
smoldering phase of a fire when large rotten logs 
and duff or peat are consumed, can sometimes 
result in high particle emissions due to less 
complete combustion than when flames are present. 
Smoldering fuels are the sign of a cooler fire so 
smoke generally stays closer to the source and closer 
15
to the ground, and air quality impacts are often closer 
to the fire, especially at night and downslope of 
smoldering activity.
Meteorology and smoke
Weather conditions such as wind, temperature, and 
humidity contribute to fire behavior and smoke 
accumulation. Winds brings a fresh supply of oxygen 
to the fire and pushes the fire into new fuels. Strong, 
hot, and dry winds can cause a wildfire to grow 
very rapidly or “blow up”. Winds also move smoke 
away from the fire and contribute to atmospheric 
mixing meaning smoke impacts to the public may 
be lessened near the fire although winds can move 
smoke long distances into communities far from 
where the wildfire is burning (Figure 3).  
Once smoke enters the atmosphere, its concentration 
at any one place and time depends on mechanisms 
of transport and dispersion. Transport refers to 
whatever process may carry a plume vertically or 
horizontally in the atmosphere. Vertical transport is 
controlled by the buoyancy of the smoke plume and 
stability of the atmosphere. Horizontal transport 
is controlled by wind. The larger the volume of 
space that smoke is allowed to enter and the farther 
it can be transported, the more dispersed and less 
concentrated it will become.   
The intense heat generated by an active wildfire 
drives smoke high into the air where it remains until 
it cools and begins to descend. As smoke moves 
downwind, it becomes more dilute and often more 
widespread, eventually reaching ground level. Terrain 
also affects localized weather. For example, as the 
sun warms mountain slopes, air is heated and rises, 
bringing smoke and fire with it. After sunlight passes, 
the terrain cools and the air begins to descend. This 
creates a down-slope airflow that can alter the smoke 
dispersal pattern seen during the day. These daily 
cycles sometimes help predict repeating patterns of 
smoke impacts in communities.
In the evening, especially in mountain valleys and 
low-lying areas, temperature inversions in which the 
air near the ground is cooler than the air above are 
common. Temperature inversions prevent upward 
air movement. The lid effect of inversions, coupled 
with a drop in wind speed, can favor smoke and 
pollutant accumulation in valleys close to the fire at 
night. Strong inversions can also allow for smoke 
to accumulate in an area for days or weeks with 
little opportunity for clean air to help improve 
smoke concentrations. 
Smoke levels in populated areas can be difficult to 
predict and will often depend on a suite of local 
terrain, weather, and fire-behavior-based factors. A 
wind that usually clears out a valley may simply blow 
more smoke in or may fan the fires, causing a worse 
episode the next day. Smoke concentrations change 
constantly. Sometimes, by the time officials can issue 
a warning or smoke advisory, the smoke may already 
have cleared. 
Wildland fire management
Most of the tens of thousands of wildfires in the 
United States are suppressed during initial attack 
efforts. For many jurisdictions, from federal to 
private lands, there are specific plans in place 
addressing fire suppression efforts and response. For 
federal land managers, land management plans are 
created with annually updated fire management plans 
that help guide the appropriate response to a wildfire 
in a specific area. When these land management 
plans are revised, they undergo public review, which 
provides an opportunity for input on how the land is 
managed by a federal agency. 
When there is an ignition, whether human caused or 
from lightning, the first order of business is always 
protecting the safety of the public and fire fighters. 
Some wildfires continue past the initial attack or 
occur in areas where the risks of attack are high or 
the likelihood of suppression success is low. Such 
fires can become large, of long duration, and a 
significant source of smoke. When these wildfires 
elude initial attack efforts, exceed local firefighting 
capabilities, or become large quickly, the land owner 
or, for federal lands, the agency administrator, has 
16
the opportunity to engage external assistance for 
additional resources to assist their local efforts. On 
these types of fires, an Incident Management Team 
(IMT) is usually engaged. The land owner/manager/
agency administrator where the wildfire is burning 
advises the IMT on strategies, constraints, and 
priorities so that fire management and suppression 
efforts align with other land management goals 
in the area.  
Fire management strategies designed for a remote 
wildfire in a wilderness area will be much different 
from tactics used on lands adjacent to or in 
communities. Wildfires in remote areas with no risk 
to public resources may be monitored and largely 
left to take a natural course and eventually burn 
themselves out, especially when firefighting resources 
are scarce. Similarly, only sections of a wildfire 
may be suppressed due to resource capabilities or 
threats to public and private resources. Wildfires 
that threaten homes or other infrastructure will be 
attacked aggressively. This may include retardant 
drops from aircraft, bulldozers, fire engines, and 
multiple 20-person fire crews. Public and firefighter 
safety is considered above all else in determining the 
fire management or suppression approach that will 
be implemented.
Incident Management 
T
eams
An IMT is a group of trained professionals that 
respond to national, regional, or local emergencies. 
IMTs are used to manage large-scale, complex 
wildfire incidents. Team members have expertise in 
finance, logistics, operations, information, safety, 
planning, public information, and other areas needed 
to manage a wildfire. Every incident management 
team has an incident commander to oversee and 
control the infrastructure of the team. IMTs work, 
eat, and sleep in a safe location near the wildfire 
frequently in camps or nearby public facilities. The 
IMTs hold both public and cooperator meetings 
where updates about the fire, upcoming fire tactics, 
and concerns are discussed. These are important 
opportunities for engagement on smoke issues.
If smoke and air quality issues become a concern, 
the IMT can order a technical specialist called an Air 
Resource Advisor (ARA). ARAs come from a variety 
of backgrounds but have specialized training in 
health effects of fine particles, air quality monitoring, 
smoke dispersion modeling, predicting future air 
quality, and communicating this information to the 
public in an understandable and consistent way. 
Much of the work of an ARA fits well with the work 
of public health officials because ARAs produce a 
“Smoke Outlook” that tells when and where smoke 
levels will be high during the next couple of days. 
Further discussion and an example outlook can be 
found in Chapter 4.

III. SPECIFIC STRATEGIES TO
REDUCE EXPOSURE TO
WILDFIRE SMOKE
18
In areas where the public is experiencing wildfire 
smoke exposure, public health and air quality 
agencies should provide advice on actions that can 
be taken to reduce smoke exposure. The following 
strategies to reduce wildfire smoke exposure can be 
used individually or in combination by individuals 
and communities, as feasible and appropriate 
for the smoke event they are experiencing. 
Recommendations for communicating these 
strategies to the public are provided in Chapter 5 and 
summarized in Table 4.
Individuals with heart or lung disease who are 
concerned about the potential health implications of 
exposure to wildfire smoke and actions they can take 
to limit exposures, should be advised to discuss this 
with their primary health care provider. They should 
also check the Air Quality Index (AQI, discussed 
below) each day for the air quality forecast and for 
information about ways to reduce exposure.
Stay indoors
The most common advisory issued during a smoke 
episode is to stay indoors. The effectiveness of this 
strategy depends on how well the building limits 
smoke from coming indoors, and on efforts to 
minimize indoor pollution sources. Staying indoors 
will provide some protection from smoke, especially 
in a tightly closed, air-conditioned home in which 
the air conditioner recirculates indoor air. Generally, 
newer homes are “tighter” and keep ambient air 
pollution out more effectively than older homes.
Staying inside with the doors and windows closed 
can reduce the entry of outdoor air into homes, in 
some cases by a third or more (Howard-Reed et al., 
2002). Homes with central air conditioning generally 
recirculate indoor air, though some smoky outdoor 
air can still be drawn inside (e.g., when people enter 
or exit or when the central system can be set to bring 
in outdoor air). In homes without air conditioning, 
indoor concentrations of fine particles can approach 
70–100% of the outdoor concentrations; however, it 
is more common that the indoor concentrations of 
fine particles that come from outdoors are 50% or 
less of outdoor concentrations when windows and 
doors are closed (Allen et al. 2012, Chen and Zhao 
2011, Singer et al. 2016). In very leaky homes and 
buildings, outdoor particles can easily infiltrate the 
indoor air, so guidance to stay inside may offer little 
protection. In any home, if doors and windows are 
open, particle levels indoors and outdoors will be 
about the same.
Sometimes smoke events can last for weeks or even 
months. These longer events are usually punctuated 
by periods of relatively clean air. When air quality 
improves, even temporarily, residents should “air 
out” their homes to reduce indoor air pollution. 
People who wish to clean their residences after or 
between wildfire smoke events should use cleaning 
practices that reduce re-suspension of particles that 
have settled, including damp mopping or dusting and 
using a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter-
equipped vacuum.
Staying indoors is a recommended strategy for 
avoiding both heat and smoke exposure, as long as 
the indoor air environment is protected. In high-
heat conditions, people are advised to stay cool, stay 
hydrated, and stay inside. An important caveat about 
advising people to stay inside and close windows 
and doors of homes without air conditioning is the 
increased risk of heat stress. Even without smoke 
exposure, extreme heat poses a substantial health 
risk, especially for at-risk groups, including young 
children, the elderly, those with chronic diseases 
or disabilities, and pregnant women. These at-risk 
groups largely overlap with those at higher risk from 
smoke exposures. Heat-related illnesses include heat 
exhaustion, heat stroke and death. Warning signs 
include heavy sweating, muscle cramps, weakness, 
headache, nausea, vomiting, paleness, confusion, 
fainting (passing out), and dizziness. To prevent 
overheating, use cool compresses, misting, showers, 
baths, and drink plenty of water. In some high-
heat conditions, windows and doors will need to be 
opened to allow cooling even if smoke enters.
People who do not have air conditioning at home 
should be advised to visit family members, neighbors, 
or public buildings with air conditioning and 
appropriate air filtration (such as a shopping mall, 
library, cooling center, or movie theatre) during high 
19
smoke conditions to cool off for a few hours each 
day. Public health officials should get information 
about cooling and filtration status of buildings before 
recommending where people can seek shelter from 
heat or smoke. Some public buildings may have older 
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) 
systems that use low-efficiency filters (see section 
below on air conditioners and filters). 
In preparation for the fire season or a smoke event, 
it is a good idea to have enough food on hand to last 
several days, to minimize driving and trips outdoors. 
Foods stored for use during the fire season should 
not require frying or broiling, since these activities 
can add particles to indoor air. It is also important to 
have at least a several-day supply of medication for 
the same reason. 
Guidance on protecting office and other indoor 
workers from wildfire smoke has been developed 
by the California Division of Occupational Safety 
and Health (Cal/OSHA), in consultation with 
technical staff from several other California agencies 
(Appendix D) . This guidance describes how to 
maximize the protection provided by HVAC systems 
common in public and commercial buildings, as well 
as other steps to protect occupants.
Reduce activity
Reducing physical activity lowers the dose of inhaled 
air pollutants and reduces health risks during a 
smoke event. When exercising, people can increase 
their air intake 10 to 20 times over their resting level. 
Increased breathing rates bring more pollution deep 
into the lungs. People tend to breathe through their 
mouths during exercise, bypassing the natural filtering 
ability of the nasal passages and delivering more 
pollution to the lungs. They also tend to breathe 
more deeply, modifying the usual patterns of lung 
particle deposition. This guidance addresses outdoor 
exercise during smoky periods; residents need not be 
discouraged from indoor exercise in an environment 
with acceptable air quality. 
Reduce other sources of indoor 
air pollution
Indoor sources of air pollution such as smoking 
cigarettes, using gas or wood-burning stoves and 
furnaces, spraying aerosol products, frying and 
broiling meat, burning candles and incense, and 
vacuuming can all increase indoor particle levels. 
Some of these same pollutants are also present 
in wildfire smoke. Reducing indoor air pollutant 
emissions during smoke events can decrease indoor 
particle levels.
Cigarette smoke significantly increases levels of 
particles and other pollutants. For instance, in a 
closed room of 125 square feet, it takes only 10 
minutes for the smoke of four cigarettes to generate 
hazardous levels of particles (644 micrograms per 
cubic meter of air or µg/m3 PM2.5). The second 
largest source of indoor air pollutants is indoor 
combustion sources without proper ventilation to the 
outdoors. “Room-vented” or “vent-free” appliances 
such as unvented gas or propane fireplaces, 
decorative logs, and portable heaters can contribute 
substantial quantities of particles to indoor air and 
are of significant concern. Frying or broiling some 
foods also can produce high levels of particles in 
the kitchen and dining areas. These sources can 
also increase the levels of polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbon monoxide, acrolein, 
and nitrogen oxides, all of which are potentially 
harmful to health. In addition, small sources such as 
candles and incense burning can produce surprisingly 
large quantities of particles and should not be used 
during wildfire smoke events. To avoid re-suspending 
particles, do not vacuum during a smoke event, 
unless using a HEPA-filter-equipped vacuum. When 
cleaning, use a damp mop or damp dust cloth to 
minimize re-suspending settled particles. 
Use air conditioners and filters
When wildfire risk rises, and before the smoke 
arrives, public health agencies can help their 
communities prepare by developing public service 
announcements with information about upgrading 
the filters in their central air systems. The message 
should include information about different filter 
20
types, the importance of stocking up on filters ahead 
of wildfire season, and how to turn off fresh air 
intakes. Highlight the importance of creating clean 
air spaces in homes with individuals in at-risk groups 
and encourage residents to install high-efficiency 
filters (MERV 13 or higher), if possible. Engage 
with local health care professionals and provide 
information they can pass on to their patients. A 
fact sheet on indoor air filtration and air cleaners is 
available at: https://www.airnow.gov/publications/
wildfire-smoke-guide/wildfire-smoke-indoor-air-
filtration-factsheet
Homes with central air conditioners generally have 
lower concentrations of particles from the outdoors 
compared to homes that use open windows for 
ventilation. Much less is known about the effect 
of using various types of room air conditioners 
(e.g., window units) and their air filters on smoke 
concentrations in homes. Most air conditioners 
are designed by default to recirculate indoor air. 
Those systems that have both “outdoor air” and 
“recirculate” settings need to be set on “recirculate” 
during smoke events. Other types of air conditioners, 
such as swamp coolers, can actually bring in large 
quantities of outdoor air. Below is a brief overview 
of common types of cooling systems. 
Central air systems
Central heating and air conditioning systems (and 
some room air conditioners) contain filters that 
remove some airborne particles with different degrees 
of efficiency. The most helpful parameter for 
understanding the efficiency of HVAC filters is the 
fractional removal efficiency. The most widely used 
test method for HVAC filters in the United States is 
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and 
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 
52.2, which evaluates the removal efficiency for 
particles 0.3 to 10 μm in diameter. Results are 
reported as a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value 
(MERV) ranging from MERV 1 to MERV 16 based 
on the average removal efficiency across three particle 
size ranges: 0.3–1 μm, 1–3 μm, and 3–10 μm (Table 
2). Other commercially common proprietary rating 
systems for in-duct air filters include the 
Microparticle Performance Rating (MPR) and Filter 
Performance Rating (FPR). In general, the higher the 
filter rating, the higher the filter’s removal efficiency 
for at least one particle size range. 
If possible, the HVAC filter should be replaced 
with a pleated medium- or high-efficiency particle 
filter. Higher-efficiency filters (e.g., filters rated 
at MERV 13 or higher) are relatively inexpensive 
and preferred because they can capture more of 
the fine particles associated with smoke and can 
reduce the amount of outdoor air pollution that 
gets indoors. However, caution must be taken to 
ensure that the central system is able to handle the 
increased airflow resistance from a higher-efficiency 
filter. Consultation with an HVAC technician or the 
central air system manufacturer may be necessary 
to confirm if or which high-efficiency filters will 
work with an individual system. Filters need to 
be replaced regularly and should fit the filter slot 
snugly. Filters only remove particles while the 
system fan is operating and passing air through the 
filter. Regardless of whether a filter upgrade has 
been performed, during a wildfire smoke event, the 
central system’s circulating fan can be set to operate 
continuously (i.e., fan switch on the thermostat set 
to “ON” rather than “AUTO”) to obtain maximum 
particle removal by the HVAC filter, although this 
will increase energy use and costs (Fisk and Chan 
2017). The thermostat can be reset back to “AUTO” 
after the wildfire smoke clears.
In addition to high- and medium-efficiency filters, 
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) or other electronic 
particle air cleaners can sometimes be added by a 
technician to central air conditioning systems to 
keep particle levels in indoor air within acceptable 
levels during a prolonged smoke event. However, 
ESPs may produce some amount of  ozone 
as a byproduct, so only ESPs that have been 
independently tested and produce little or no ozone 
should be used.
For newer air conditioners with a “fresh air 
ventilation system” that brings in outdoor air 
continuously or semi-continuously, the “fresh air” 
setting for the system should be turned off during 
smoke events. This may require closing the outdoor 
21
air damper or sealing off outdoor air intakes, setting 
the system on “recirculate” only, or turning off the 
energy- or heat-recovery ventilator or exhaust fans 
that are part of the system. If the control system 
instructions are not clear or accessible, residents 
should contact their builder or heating and cooling 
contractor to help temporarily adjust the system. 
However, residents should also place a reminder tag 
in a visible spot so that they reset the system once the 
smoke clears. 
Many newer homes currently have whole-dwelling 
mechanical ventilation systems that intentionally 
bring outdoor air inside, often designed to meet 
the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.2. This 
can be achieved through dedicated supply ductwork 
(creating positive pressure in the building), controlled 
exhaust ventilation (creating negative pressure in the 
building), or “balanced” ventilation strategies that 
typically employ a heat recovery or energy recovery 
ventilator (HRV/ERV). Mechanical ventilation 
in new homes is now required by building codes 
in some jurisdictions. These systems may need to 
be turned off or adjusted during periods of high 
outdoor air pollution from wildfires to avoid entry of 
outdoor air pollutants, especially exhaust ventilation 
systems. Mechanical ventilation systems used in 
public and commercial buildings differ and are 
discussed further in appendices B and D.
Swamp coolers
Many older homes use evaporative coolers, known as 
“swamp coolers,” to condition the air in the home. A 
cooler unit operates by evaporating water off large 
pads located in the cooler housing. The unit also 
contains the fan motor, fan, water tray, and pump 
and is usually located on the roof of a house. The 
coolers rely on bringing large volumes of outside air 
into the home and they will not cool effectively if 
the home is sealed up and the incoming air cannot 
be exhausted from the home. Although a laboratory 
study has shown that evaporative coolers can reduce 
PM10 up to 50%, and PM2.5 by 10–40% (Paschold et 
al., 2003), other outdoor pollutants such as ozone are 
not filtered out and can reach indoor levels that are 
nearly equal to the outdoor levels. Therefore, unless 
there is a heat emergency, evaporative coolers should 
not be used during periods when there is heavy 
smoke outside. 
Ductless mini-split systems
Some new or recently renovated homes may have 
ductless mini-split heat pumps or air conditioning 
systems. Ductless mini-split systems, which use an 
air handling unit mounted inside the home’s pressure 
boundary, will still cool effectively in a home that 
has been sealed up to minimize smoke infiltration 
and generally do not compromise indoor air quality. 
These systems have the advantage of not requiring

ductwork throughout the attic or basement space. 
From an air-balance standpoint, these systems do 
not significantly affect the air pressure in the home 
and do not result in extra air being brought into or 
exhausted from the home. Some mini-split systems 
include ducts connected to a low-profile air handler, 
which may be installed in an unconditioned area and 
may be susceptible to outdoor air exchange issues, 
depending on the effectiveness of the duct sealing 
during installation.
Window-mounted and portable air 
conditioners
Some residences are cooled or heated using window-
mounted air conditioners. To function properly 
and efficiently, these units must form a tight seal 
with the window frame in which they are mounted. 
People who have window units should be advised to 
check the quality of the seal by looking around the 
perimeter of the window unit for any visible gaps. 
Light or air leaking in from the outside is an easy way 
to determine whether the seal is tight. Also, window 
units can be operated in recirculation mode or fresh 
air mode. During a high smoke event, people should 
be advised to set the window AC unit to operate in 
recirculation mode. 
Use of a single-hose portable air conditioner might 
result in outdoor smoke being drawn into the 
home. Portable air conditioners are usually used to 
condition the air in a single room of the home. These 
units have a cooling capacity that can range from 
6,000 to 15,000 BTU and many of these units also 
have a heating mode of operation. Depending on 
the make and model, a portable air conditioner will 
have either a single- or dual-hose configuration. The 
single-hose configuration expels hot exhaust air to 
the exterior of the home, but the supply air is taken 
from the home itself, so the net effect is that the 
room is placed under slight negative pressure. This 
means that air is drawn into the home through any 
leaky points in the building envelope. This is not a 
problem with dual-hose configurations, because they 
draw and deliver supply air from the outside so the 
air pressure inside the room remains balanced. 
Use room air cleaners
Choosing to buy an air cleaner is a decision that 
ideally should be made before a smoke emergency 
occurs, particularly in homes with occupants in at-
risk groups. During a smoke emergency, it may be 
hazardous to go outside or drive, and appropriate 
devices may be in short supply. It is unlikely that local 
health officials or non-governmental organizations 
will be able to buy or supply air cleaners to those 
who might need them. Note that air cleaners are 
frequently referred to as “air purifiers” by retailers 
and the general public. 
Choose an air cleaner appropriate for the size 
of the indoor environment
Air cleaners can help reduce indoor particle levels, 
provided the specific air cleaner is properly matched 
to the size of the indoor environment. Room air 
cleaners are available as portable units designed to 
clean the air in a single room ($90–$900). Central air 
cleaners, which may be large portable units or in-duct 
units installed by an HVAC professional, are intended 
to clean the whole house ($450–$1,500). Central 
air cleaners can be more effective than room air 
cleaners (depending on how much they are operated), 
although two or more well-placed portable air 
cleaners can be equally effective, and their cost may 
still be less than a large central air cleaner. 
Room air cleaner units should be sized to provide a 
filtered airflow at least two to three times the room 
volume per hour. Most portable units will state on 
the package the unit’s airflow rate, the room size it 
is suitable for, its particle removal efficiency, and 
perhaps its Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). The 
CADR is a rating that combines efficiency and 
airflow.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
(AHAM) maintains a certification program for air 
cleaners. The AHAM seal on the air cleaner’s box lists 
separate CADR numbers for tobacco smoke, pollen, 
and dust. Higher numbers indicate faster filtration 
of the air. For wildfire smoke, choose a unit with a 
tobacco smoke CADR at least 2/3 of the room’s 
area. For example, a 10’ x 12’ room (120 square feet) 
would require an air cleaner with a tobacco smoke 
23
CADR of at least 80. If the ceiling is higher than 8’, 
an air cleaner rated for a larger room will be needed.
Choose an air cleaner that effectively removes 
particles without producing ozone
The two common mechanisms for particle removal 
include:
•	
Mechanical air cleaners that contain a fiber or
fabric filter. The filters need to fit tightly in their
holders and be cleaned or replaced regularly.
HEPA filters (and Ultra-Low Penetration Air
[ULPA] filters, which are not generally available
for residential use) are most efficient at removing
particles.
•	
Electronic air cleaners, such as electrostatic pre­
cipitators (ESPs) and ionizers. ESPs use a small
electrical charge to collect particles from air
pulled through the device. Electronic air cleaners
usually produce small amounts of ozone (a respi­
ratory irritant) and some, especially those that are
combined with other technologies, may produce
substantial levels of ozone (see next section on
Ozone Generators). Only ESPs that have been
independently tested and documented to produce
little or no ozone should be used. Ionizers, or
negative ion generators, cause particles to stick to
materials (such as carpet and walls) near the de­
vice and are also often a source of ozone. Ionized
particles deposited on room surfaces can cause
soiling and, if disturbed, can be resuspended into
the indoor air.
Only portable (room) air cleaners that do not 
produce ozone above 0.050 ppm should be used 
(see below). The California Air Resources Board 
(CARB) certifies air cleaners that produce little or no 
ozone and only CARB-certified air cleaners may be 
sold in California.  
A list of CARB-certified air cleaners can be found 
at: https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/
aircleaners/certified.htm. 
Place and operate the air cleaner to maximize 
particle removal
Room air cleaners will provide the most protection 
when placed where people spend the most time, such 
as a bedroom. A good portable air cleaner placed in 
a bedroom may be particularly helpful to a person 
with asthma or COPD. For retired or homebound 
individuals, the portable room air cleaner should 
be set up in whichever room is used the most. 
To maximize air cleaner effectiveness, operate it 
continuously, or as often as possible. Use the highest 
fan speed and make sure the air flow to the air 
cleaner is not obstructed. Keep outside doors and 
windows closed to prevent additional particles from 
entering the room.
Air cleaners can be used in combination with central 
air system filter upgrades described in the preceding 
section to maximize the reduction of indoor 
particles. Air cleaners alone can effectively reduce 
particle concentrations even in homes that do not 
have central air conditioning if windows and doors 
remain closed and excessive heat is not a concern. 
Under normal (non-smoky) conditions, portable 
air cleaners fitted high-efficiency filters can reduce 
indoor particle concentrations by as much as 90 
percent (Singer et al. 2016). During a wildfire smoke 
event, portable air cleaners fitted with high-efficiency 
filters may reduce indoor particle concentrations by 
as much as 45% (Fisk and Chan 2017).
Air cleaners for gases and odors
Most air cleaners are not effective at removing gases 
and odors, although some specialized models that 
perform this task well are available. Devices that 
remove gases and odors can cost more than particle 
air filters, both to purchase and maintain. They force 
air through materials such as activated charcoal 
or alumina coated with potassium permanganate. 
However, with smaller-sized air cleaners, the filtering 
medium can become quickly overloaded and may 
need to be replaced often. Large gas-removing 
devices may be useful for individuals that encompass 
an at-risk lifestage or population and may require 
less-frequent replacement of the filtering medium. 
New models that combine particle and gas removal 
are available in both portable and in-duct models.
Do-it-yourself box fan air cleaners
Some organizations provide instructions to assemble 
a do-it-yourself (DIY) box fan air cleaner by 
24
attaching a high-efficiency filter to a box fan. There 
is currently some limited evidence to support the 
filtration efficacy of these DIY devices. However, 
concerns have been raised that the box fan motor 
may overheat when operated with a filter attached. 
We expect there will be more research conducted 
on the safety and efficacy of DIY air cleaners in 
the coming years. In the meantime, though there is 
not enough evidence for us to endorse their use, we 
acknowledge that during a wildfire smoke event some 
people may choose to assemble a DIY air cleaner 
to reduce their exposure to wildfire smoke. Those 
who make this choice should be advised to use the 
device with caution and not to operate it unattended 
or when sleeping, to avoid any potential fire or 
electrical hazard.

Avoid ozone generators 
Some devices, known as ozone generators, personal 
air purifiers, “super-oxygen” air purifiers, and 
“pure air” generators, are sold as air cleaners, but 
the position of public health agencies, including 
the California Air Resources Board and U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, is that they do 
more harm than good. These devices are designed 
to intentionally produce large amounts of ozone gas. 
Ozone generator manufacturers claim that ozone 
can remove mold and bacteria from the air, but this 
occurs only when ozone is released at levels many 
times higher than those that are known to harm 
human health.
Relatively low levels of ozone can irritate the 
airways, causing coughing, chest pain and tightness, 
and shortness of breath. Low levels of ozone can 
also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as 
asthma and compromise the body’s ability to fight 
respiratory infections. As a result, using an ozone 
generator during a smoke event may actually increase 
the adverse effects from the smoke. In addition, 
ozone gas does not remove particles from the air 
and can lead to particle formation; ozone reacts 
with certain chemicals commonly found indoors to 
produce particles and formaldehyde. California now 
prohibits the sale of air cleaners that emit potentially 
harmful amounts of ozone. A list of air cleaners that 
California has certified to emit little or no ozone is 
available at:
https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/
aircleaners/certified.htm

marketed as air cleaners:

generators-are-sold-air-cleaners
https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/ozone.htm 
Humidifiers
Humidifiers are not air cleaners and will not 
significantly reduce the number of particles in the 
air during a smoke event. Nor will they remove gases 
like carbon monoxide. However, humidifiers and 
dehumidifiers (depending on the environment) may 
slightly reduce pollutants through condensation, 
absorption, and other mechanisms. In an arid 
environment, one possible benefit of running 
a humidifier during a smoke event might be to 
help the mucous membranes remain comfortably 
moist, which may reduce eye and airway irritation. 
However, if not properly cleaned and maintained, 
some humidifiers can circulate mold spores and 
other biological contaminants. The usefulness 
of humidification during a smoke event has not 
been studied.
25
Create a clean room at home
Creating an in-home “clean room” is a good 
exposure reduction strategy for people who live in 
areas regularly affected by wildfire smoke—especially 
those with pre-existing conditions that increase the 
risk of air pollution-related health effects. It is also 
a good strategy for those who must work outside 
so that they can breathe cleaner air while indoors at 
home after work. A good choice for a clean room 
is an interior room with few windows and doors, 
such as a bedroom.  Anyone who cannot create an 
adequate clean room in their own home should be 
encouraged to seek out cleaner air shelters or cleaner 
air spaces located in their communities for periods of 
respite from the smoke (see discussion below).  
Some suggestions for creating and maintaining a 
clean room:
•	
Keep windows and doors closed.
•	
Set up a properly sized room air cleaner (see
above) to help remove particles from the air while
emitting little or no ozone.
•	
Run an air conditioner or central air conditioning
system. If the air conditioner provides a fresh air
option, keep the fresh-air intake closed to prevent
smoke from getting inside. Make sure that the fil­
ter is clean enough to allow good airflow indoors.
•	
Do not vacuum anywhere in the house, unless
using a HEPA-filter equipped vacuum.
•	
Do not smoke or burn anything, including can­
dles or incense, anywhere in the house.
•	
Keep the room clean by damp mopping or dust­
ing with a damp cloth.
•	
Long-term smoke events usually have periods
when the air is better. When air quality improves,
even temporarily, air out your home to reduce
indoor air pollution.
•	
People in homes that are too warm to stay inside
with the windows closed or who are at-risk of
smoke-related health effects should seek shel­
ter elsewhere. Keep in mind that many particles
will enter the home even if all of these steps are
taken.

Create a Clean Room to Protect Indoor Air Qual­
ity During a Wildfire.
Cleaner air shelters and cleaner 
air spaces
Public health officials in areas at risk from wildfire 
smoke episodes should identify and evaluate public 
spaces where people can seek relief from wildfire 
smoke. For the purposes of this guide, these public 
spaces are defined as either cleaner air shelters or 
cleaner air spaces. People should be made aware 
that driving to and from a public shelter or cleaner 
air space for short-term relief and the stress of 
evacuating for an extended stay in a shelter can also 
have health consequences. Therefore, whether to 
create a clean room at home or leave for a public 
shelter or cleaner air space will depend on factors 
that the individual must assess. 
Cleaner air shelters 
Cleaner air shelters are public spaces for people 
who are displaced by wildfire or smoke. People 
who take refuge in these shelters may only need 
to stay overnight or may need the shelter for 
extended periods (days or even weeks). Some 
examples of cleaner air shelters are school 
gymnasiums, buildings at public fairgrounds, and 
civic auditoriums. A cleaner air shelter may also be 
considered an evacuation shelter but be aware that 
not all evacuation centers provide cleaner air for the 
occupants. Therefore, public health officials in areas 
at risk from wildfire smoke episodes should identify 
and evaluate public spaces where people can shelter 
from wildfire smoke well in advance of fire season. 
Guidance for identifying or setting up a cleaner air 
shelter is provided in Appendix B. 
Cleaner air spaces
During severe smoke events, it is often impractical or 
impossible for people to set up a clean room in their 
homes. Individuals who cannot create an adequate 
clean room should be encouraged to seek out cleaner 
air spaces located in their communities for periods of 
respite from the smoke. People can find temporary 
relief from smoke, heat, or cold at public cleaner air 
26
spaces for several hours, or perhaps for the better 
part of a day; however, many of these commercial 
spaces and public facilities are unlikely to be open at 
night. Examples of cleaner air spaces could include 
libraries, museums, shopping malls, theaters, sports 
arenas, senior centers, and any indoor area with 
effective particle filtration and air conditioning.    
Inside vehicles
Individuals can reduce the amount of smoke in their 
vehicles by keeping the windows and vents closed, 
and, if available, operating the air conditioning in 
“recirculate” mode. However, in hot weather, a car’s 
interior can heat up very quickly to temperatures 
that far exceed that outdoors and heat stress or heat 
exhaustion can result. Children and pets should 
never be left unattended in a vehicle with the 
windows closed. The ventilation systems of older 
cars typically remove a small portion of the particles 
coming in from outside. Newer models may have 
better air filters that remove more particles from the 
air, but the vehicle owner should not assume that 
they will get the same level of protection they would 
get from a dedicated clean room or cleaner air space. 
Most vehicles can recirculate the inside air, which will 
help keep the particle levels lower.
Drivers should check the owner’s manual and 
assure that the system is set correctly to minimize 
entry of outdoor smoke and particles. However, 
studies have shown that carbon dioxide levels can 
quickly accumulate to very high levels (possibly 
exceeding 2500 parts per million) in newer cars 
due to occupants’ exhaled breath when vents and 
windows are closed and the recirculation setting is 
used (Fruin et al. 2011, Hudda and Fruin 2018, Lee 
and Zhu 2014). Therefore, if driving a recent model 
vehicle for more than a short period of time, it may 
be a good idea to briefly open windows or vents 
occasionally when smoke levels are low to avoid the 
build-up of carbon dioxide. Finally, vehicles should 
not be used as a shelter, but rather as a means of 
transportation to indoor locations with cleaner air.
Respiratory protection for wildfire 
smoke and ash
Respiratory protection (commonly referred to 
as “masks”) can be useful for reducing personal 
inhalation of wildfire smoke or ash. Respirators are 
widely available and offer some protection for adults 
if selected and used properly, although the public 
should be advised to take more effective measures 
first to limit their exposures. Information provided 
in this section describes selection and proper use 
of tight-fitting particulate respirators certified by 
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH). 
Drawbacks to recommending the use of respirators 
include the possibility that users will select the wrong 
type or use them incorrectly. A stand-alone factsheet, 
Protect Your Lungs from Wildfire Smoke or Ash, 
has been designed for the public and includes links 
to other resources. The use of respiratory protection 
without first ensuring that no medical conditions 
exist that would make use of respiratory protection 
a risk or first providing users with “fit tests” to 
ensure a reliable seal to the face is not ideal although 
inevitable in the case of public wildfire smoke 
exposure. A fit test is a procedure that quantitatively 
or qualitatively evaluates the fit of a specific model 
and size of respirator on an individual and is required 
in workplace settings. However, the respirators 
described in this section are available in multiple sizes 
and are likely to provide some protection to users 
who can achieve a reasonably close fit to the face, 
even without fit testing.
Respirators described in this section would also help 
to protect the public involved in cleaning up fire 
ash. There is additional guidance in this document 
on wildfire ash, and a factsheet for the public on 
cleaning up ash, Protect Yourself from Ash.
Respiratory protection use in workplace situations 
is beyond the scope of this section, see Chapter 
5, Protecting Outdoor Workers. Employers who 
anticipate that their workers may need to wear 
respiratory protection are expected to put in place 
a full respiratory protection program prior to use. 
27
In emergency situations, employers should consult 
the applicable Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) program for current 
guidance. Where respirator use is not required by 
OSHA regulations or by the employer, the employer 
may provide respirators at the request of employees 
or permit employees to use their own respirators, if 
the employer determines that such respirator use will 
not in itself create a hazard and provides some basic 
information about proper use and the limitations of 
respirators.
Children and respirator use
Respirators are not made to fit children and will not 
protect them from breathing wildfire smoke. Children 
are especially at risk from exposure to wildfire smoke 
because their lungs are still developing. Reduce 
children’s exposure to wildfire smoke by checking 
air quality, keeping them indoors, creating a clean air 
room, and being ready to evacuate if necessary. See 
also the factsheet Protecting Children from Wildfire 
Smoke or Ash. 
NIOSH does not currently certify respirators for 
children. As new research findings on efficacy 
become available, guidance by U.S. government 
agencies may be issued on the proper use of 
respirators by older children. 
Who may need to wear a respirator
The most effective action the public can take to 
reduce the risk of health effects from inhalation 
of wildfire smoke or ash is to stay indoors or limit 
the time spent outdoors during wildfire smoke 
emergencies. People at higher risk of adverse effects, 
such as those with heart or lung disease and older 
adults, should check with their health care providers 
before using a respirator, since using a respirator 
can make it harder to breathe. If the smoke event 
is expected to be prolonged, these groups should 
consider temporary relocation out of the smoky area.
People who must be outdoors for extended periods 
of time in smoky air or in an ash-covered area may 
benefit from using tight-fitting, NIOSH-approved 
N95 or P100 respirators to reduce their exposures. 
People experiencing health effects from a smoky 
environment, even if indoors, may also benefit from 
using N95 or P100 respirators if they cannot move 
to locations with better air quality or take other steps 
to clean their indoor air.
For people who wish to wear respirators, learning 
how to select respirators and use them correctly is 
important for achieving the best protection possible.

28
Choosing the correct respirator
Tight-fitting “particulate” respirators are designed 
to capture or filter out particles from contaminated 
air before the user can breathe them in. A “filtering 
facepiece” respirator, commonly called a disposable 
N95 or P100 respirator, has two straps and a 
facepiece made entirely of filtering material (Figure 
4). Respirators must be certified by NIOSH, and the 
words “NIOSH” and either “N95” or “P100” will 
be printed on the facepiece by the manufacturer. The 
user should select a size and model that fits over the 
nose and under the chin and seals tightly to the face. 
Any leakage around the face seal causes unfiltered 
air to enter and be inhaled by the wearer, reducing 
or eliminating the ability of the respirator to provide 
protection. A good seal is not possible if the user 
has a beard or other excess facial hair where the 
respirator seals to the face.
The numbers “95” and “100” on a respirator 
facepiece indicate that the filter material captures 
95% or 99.97%, respectively, of particles passing 
through it when tested using particles 0.3 micron in 
diameter that are the hardest to capture. However, 
when used by the public without individual user fit 
testing, there is likely little difference in effectiveness 
between N95 and P100 respirators, as leakage 
around the face seal will be a more significant factor 
determining effectiveness than filtration efficiency. 
“N” indicates filter material that is not resistant to 
degradation in the presence of oil mist; “P” identifies 
filters that are resistant. In environments where 
smoke or ash are present, N95 or P100 respirators 
can be used. Both types can be found in retail 
pharmacies, in hardware and home repair stores, 
or online. NIOSH-approved respirators with filters 
designated as N99, N100, R95, P95, and P99 are far 
less common, but would also be appropriate.
Other non-disposable NIOSH-certified respirators, 
such as elastomeric half-masks, can also be used 
for wildfire smoke or ash. They have a tight-
fitting, flexible, re-useable half-mask facepiece 
and replaceable filters or cartridges; these provide 
similar protection from particles when they are used 
with N95 or P100 particulate filters. This type of 
respirator may also be purchased with a combination 
filter and organic vapor cartridge, which can reduce 
exposure to irritating gases in smoke, such as 
aldehydes. (Disposable N95 or P100 respirators 
remove only particles, not gases or vapors.)
How to use a tight-fitting respirator
To get a secure fit, a respirator user should put the 
facepiece over the nose and under the chin and 
position one strap at the back of the neck below 
the ears, and the other at the crown or top of the 
head, above the ears. Incorrect strap placement 
is a common problem with untrained respirator 
users and may compromise the face seal and reduce 
effectiveness. 
Users must be clean-shaven where the respirator 
touches the skin. A good face seal is not possible 
with facial hair. Care should be taken so that hair, 
eyeglasses, or other objects do not interfere with the 
seal of the respirator to the face.
Some N95 or P100 respirators have a metal nose 
clip that should be pinched around the bridge of 
the nose to fit securely. The user should follow 
any instructions provided by the manufacturer for 
checking for a tight face seal.
Disposable respirators should be discarded when 
they become dirty, wet, deformed in shape, or when 
it gets harder to breathe through them. 
Possible risks from wearing a respirator
Wearing a respirator can make it harder to breathe. 
Public health officials should encourage members 
of the public who have heart or lung problems to 
consult their health care provider before using a 
respirator. 
Anyone who has difficulty breathing while wearing a 
respirator, feels dizzy, faint, or claustrophobic or has 
other symptoms, should remove it and go to a place 
with cleaner air. 
Wearing a respirator, especially if a person is 
physically active or in a hot environment, may 
increase the risk of heat-related illness. Users should 
take periodic breaks from physical activity or, if 
possible, rest in a location with cleaner air where the 
29
respirator can be removed. Rest in a cooler area such 
as in shade and adequate hydration are important for 
heat illness prevention, as is gradually acclimating 
to physical activity in hot locations. Symptoms such 
as dizziness, nausea, or feeling faint should prompt 
the user to remove the respirator and seek medical 
attention or emergency care as appropriate.
Certain “masks” do not provide protection
The public should be cautioned that masks with 
one-strap nuisance dust masks (Figure 5) or surgical 
or procedure masks with two straps that loop 
around the ears (Figure 6) are not respirators. They 
are not designed to seal tightly to the face and will 
not provide protection from wildfire smoke or ash. 
Bandanas (damp or dry), handkerchiefs, and tissues 
held over the mouth and nose also should not be 
relied on for protection.
Handling respirator shortages
In a large-scale wildfire smoke emergency, local 
supplies of N95 and P100 respirators may become 
limited or exhausted. Local health officials might 
want to monitor respirator availability and consider 
ways to increase the supply if necessary. Extra 
respirators may be available from regional or 
state stockpiles of personal protective equipment, 
or directly from respirator manufacturers and 
distributors of safety equipment.
Respiratory protection resources
An excellent (but fairly technical) NIOSH article, 
Non-occupational Uses of Respiratory Protection – 
What Public Health Organizations and Users Need 
to Know, discusses common mistakes of untrained 
users as well as best practices and provides references 
to relevant studies.
NIOSH has a searchable website entitled Approved 
N95 Particulate Filtering Facepiece Respirators 
that lists NIOSH-approved N95s alphabetically by 
manufacturer.
Public health officials can find additional information 
on the NIOSH Respirator Trusted-Source 
Information website.

Avoiding smoky periods
Smoke levels from wildfires often change 
substantially over the course of the day, so there may 
be opportunities for the public to plan necessary 
trips outside at times of day that avoid the worst 
periods of smoke. Ground-level smoke impacts are 
often forecasted and posted on state smoke blogs 
in states that use these outreach tools. For example, 
officials in California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, 
currently post forecasts to smoke blogs during 
fire season. Forecasts can also be found on the 
Inciweb site by specific named wildfire incidents 
and at the Wildland Fire Air Quality Response 
Program page (https://wildlandfiresmoke.net). 
For communities near active wildfires, smoke 
impacts often follow a pattern such as nighttime 
smoke draining downhill and settling into valleys 
before lifting out the next day. Communities farther 
downwind of a fire may see smoke arrive in the mid-
to-late afternoon and occasionally linger overnight. 
Either way, it is sometimes possible for people to 
plan their days around the smokiest times in order 
to minimize exposure. Public health officials can 
recommend the use of NowCast AQI (current air 
quality in terms of the AQI) values from nearby or 
representative monitors to help people identify and 
avoid the smokiest times of day (see). Visual range-
based estimation can be used if no monitoring is 
representative of the impact areas. Links to smoke 
forecasts can be disseminated to provide daily 
smoke impact patterns in your local Public Service 
Announcements (PSAs) (see Chapter 5). Chaper 5 
describes the Wildland Fire Air Quality Response 
Program and provides an example of a smoke 
forecast from a large wildfire.
Closures
The decision to close schools, curtail business 
activities, or cancel public events is made at the local 
level and will depend upon predicted smoke levels 
and other local conditions. Check to see if your state 
or local air quality or public health agencies have 
developed guidance that local health officials can 
reference when trying to evaluate when or where 
closures should occur. Other factors to consider are 
whether pollutant levels inside schools and businesses 
are likely to be similar to or lower than those in 
homes. Children’s physical activity may be better 
controlled in schools than in homes. On the other 
hand, smoky conditions may make travel to school 
hazardous. In many areas, it will not be practical 
to close businesses and schools, although partial 
closures may be beneficial. Closures and cancellations 
can target specific groups (e.g., the at-risk groups 
described earlier) or specific high-risk activities, 
such as outdoor sporting events and practices. 
Curtailing outside activities can reduce exposures, 
as can encouraging people to stay inside and restrict 
physical activity. 
Evacuation
The most common reason for evacuation during a 
wildfire is the direct threat of engulfment by the fire, 
rather than exposure to smoke. Leaving an area of 
thick smoke may be a good protective measure for 
members of at-risk groups, but it is often difficult 
to predict the duration, intensity, and direction of 
smoke, making this an unattractive option to many 
people. There is stress associated with evacuation and 
most people do not want to leave their homes. Even 
if smoky conditions are expected to continue for 
weeks, it may not be feasible for a large percentage 
of the affected population to evacuate. Moreover, 
the process of evacuation can entail serious risks, 
particularly if poor visibility makes driving hazardous. 
In these situations, the risks posed by driving need 
to be weighed against the potential benefits of 
evacuation. Therefore, in areas where fires are likely 
to occur, public health officials are encouraged to 
develop plans to help at-risk groups shelter locally.
Where individuals are evacuated to a common center 
because of fire danger, public health officials need 
to pay particular attention to the potential for smoke 
to affect the evacuation center itself. It is not always 
possible to locate evacuation centers far away from 
smoky areas, or to expect that evacuees will be able 
to take the steps necessary to reduce their exposures 
in their new surroundings. Public health officials 
should consider informing incident commanders 
if this situation could arise and supplying evacuees 
with information and materials to further reduce 
31
exposures, including provision of a cleaner air 
shelter within the evacuation center, if possible, as 
well as other means of respiratory protection. (See 
“Respiratory Protection” above.) It is important to 
consider smoke levels when allowing those evacuated 
for fire safety reasons to return to their homes. 
Medical capability (from available transport to urgent 
care and hospital capacity) to address smoke induced 
medical situations should be assessed if smoke levels 
are predicted to be high. Additionally, the smoke 
from smoldering natural and (if structures are burned 
in fires) possibly manmade materials pose ongoing 
hazards that should be considered.
Summary of strategies to reduce 
smoke exposure
The public should be encouraged to prepare to 
minimize trips out of the home before fire season 
arrives by having food and medicine on hand to last 
several days. Foods stored for use during a smoke 
event should not require frying or broiling, since 
these activities can add particles to indoor air. 
When smoky conditions are expected, people 
can pursue a number of strategies to reduce their 
exposure. Those with moderate to severe heart or 
lung disease might consider staying with relatives or 
friends who live away from the smoke impact area. 
If smoke is already present in substantial quantities, 
such individuals may want to evaluate whether 
their exposure during evacuation would be greater 
than staying at home and using other precautions 
described above. Depending on how sensitive they 
are to smoke, as smoke levels increase it may be 
appropriate for some people to stay in a clean room 
in the home, relocate temporarily to a cleaner air 
shelter, or to leave the area entirely if it is possible 
and safe to do so.
Everyone in a smoky area should avoid strenuous 
work or outdoor exercise to the greatest extent 
possible. They should avoid driving or if driving 
is necessary, run the air conditioner on recirculate 
mode to avoid drawing smoky air into the car. 
Smoke can also impair roadway visibility making 
driving hazardous. Guidance on protecting outdoor 
workers from wildfire smoke has been developed 
by the California Division of Occupational Safety 
and Health (Cal/OSHA). More information about 
the protection of outdoor workers can be found in 
Chapter 5.
Closing up a home by shutting windows and doors 
can give some protection from smoke. Most air 
conditioners are designed by default to recirculate 
indoor air. Systems that have both “outdoor air” and 
“recirculate” settings need to be set on “recirculate” 
during fire/smoke events to prevent smoke-laden air 
from being drawn into the building (note: this does 
not apply to HVAC systems in office and commercial 
buildings; see Appendix D). Additional protection in 
homes can be achieved by operating properly-sized 
air cleaners and upgrading the filtration efficiency of 
air filters in central air conditioning systems. High-
efficiency filters (rated at MERV 13 or higher) should 
be installed when feasible. When filters have been 
upgraded, central air conditioning fans can be set to 
operate continuously during a wildfire event, and not 
cycle on and off, although this will increase energy 
use and costs.
Once people have closed up the building in which 
they live, they should avoid strenuous activity, which 
can make them breathe harder and faster. They 
should drink plenty of fluids to keep their respiratory 
membranes moist. Vacuuming (except with HEPA 
filter-equipped vacuums) should also be avoided, 
since most vacuum cleaners disperse very fine dust 
into the air.
Smoke levels can change substantially over the course 
of the day, so it may be possible to plan your day 
around the smokiest times to minimize exposure 
using tools and information in this Guide.
NIOSH-approved disposable particulate respirators 
(e.g., N95 or P100) available in hardware stores 
and online provide some level of protection from 
exposure to particles in smoke as long as a close-
fitting model and size is selected, and they are used 
properly. One-strap paper masks, surgical masks, or 
other face coverings are not recommended since they 
provide little or no protection.

IV. COMMUNICATING AIR
QUALITY CONDITIONS
DURING SMOKE EVENTS
33
An important goal of air quality monitoring during 
a wildfire smoke event is to relay information to 
the public in a timely manner so people can make 
decisions about how to protect their health. Filter-
based PM monitors take days to process, but 
continuous PM monitors give a near real-time reading 
of PM concentrations every hour. This is an estimate 
of the 24-hour average PM AQI using the NowCast 
algorithm discussed below. Areas without continuous 
PM monitors may be able to get temporary, portable 
monitors through their federal, state, tribal, or 
local air quality agencies or the U.S. Forest Service, 
especially when associated with a wildfire incident 
with an assigned Air Resource Advisor.
Air Quality Index 
The Air Quality Index, or AQI, is a nationally 
uniform index promulgated by the EPA for 
reporting and forecasting daily air quality across 
the country. It is used to report information about 
the most common ambient air pollutants, including 
those most relevant to wildfire smoke: particulate 
matter (PM2.5 or PM10) and ozone. The AQI tells 
the public how clean or polluted the air is using 
standard descriptors (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy 
for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, 
and Hazardous). The index converts ambient 
concentrations (µg/m3 or ppb) to a number and 
category more easily understood by the public. The 
AQI uses a normalized scale from 0 to 500 and 
provides associated health-based descriptors for each 
category. An AQI value of 100 corresponds to the 
level of the short-term National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard for a given pollutant. An advantage of 
using the AQI value over the concentration (μg/m3) 
for particulate matter is that the AQI value of 100 
represents a clear demarcation between satisfactory 
and unhealthy air quality, at least with reference 
to the national standard, which is established at a 
level that will protect public health, including the 
health of at-risk groups. When AQI values exceed 
100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy, at first 
for members of at-risk groups (in the Air Quality 
Index, the term “sensitive groups” is used), then for 
everyone as AQI values increase. Another advantage 
is that the AQI provides actionable activity advice for 
at-risk groups, as well as the general public, to reduce 
smoke exposure.
AirNow
The AirNow website, at www.airnow.gov, is a multi-
agency web site run by EPA that reports air quality 
using the AQI. The AirNow program accepts, stores, 
and displays data provided by state, local, and federal 
air quality agencies. Agencies submit continuous PM 
data to AirNow from over 1,200 PM2.5 monitors and 
500 PM10 monitors, plus temporary monitors, on an 
hourly basis. These data are available to the public via 
an interactive map on airnow.gov and through email 
notifications, widgets, and smart-phone apps. Media 
outlets and web developers can also access the data 
through AirNow’s Application Program Interface 
(airnowapi.org). See Appendix C for a description of 
AirNow-Tech, a website that air quality organizations 
use for data analysis and management, including the 
Navigator tool for wildfire evaluation.
NowCast. The AQI for PM2.5 and PM10 is a daily 
(midnight to midnight) 24-hour average, so hourly 
reporting requires a methodology called the NowCast 
to estimate the 24-hour AQI for each hour. The 
reported hourly value is what AirNow calls “current 
air quality.”
The NowCast method for reporting each hour’s 
current conditions is responsive to rapidly changing 
air quality such as occurs during a wildfire (Figure 
7) The NowCast uses a weighted average of the
previous 12 hours. When air quality is changing
rapidly, the most recent hours are weighted more
heavily. A longer average, approaching 12 hours,
Figure 7. Overall concept of the NowCastFigure 7: Diagram of the NowCast showing that a shorter averaging time is used when air quality is changing rapidly.
34
is used when air quality is stable. The NowCast 
helps ensure that AQI maps and data on AirNow 
more closely match what people actually experience 
outdoors (Figure 8).
Fires: current conditions map. The wildfire map 
page on airnow.gov (https://fire.airnow.gov) is a one-
stop place where the public can assess current wildfire 
activity and air quality conditions across the country 
(Figure 9). The interactive map is a joint effort of the 
U.S. Forest Service, EPA, and state and local 
air quality agencies. The map displays several layers 
such as the current network of PM2.5 monitors as well 
as any temporary PM2.5 monitors deployed for a fire 
event. The monitors are shown in the color of their 
current AQI value. Other layers include active 
wildfires and smoke plumes. In addition, the page has 
important links to state advisories and smoke blogs, 
information about smoke and health, and a variety of 
external web resources pertaining to wildfires.
Enviroflash. Offered in many areas around the 
country, EnviroFlash is a system that sends the daily 
air quality forecast by email to anyone who signs up. 
It can also be used by state and local agencies to send 
Figure 8. Sample AirNow current air quality data, map, and AQI values

an email alert during an event such as a fire, including 
suggested safety measures which are included when 
air quality is unhealthy. This service is provided by 
the state or local environmental agency and EPA. 
Information about Enviroflash is available at http://
www.enviroflash.info.
Outdoor activity guidance. The Air Quality 
and Outdoor Activity Guidance for Schools table, 
developed by the EPA and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), shows when and 
how to modify outdoor physical activity based on the 
AQI. This guidance can help protect the health of all 
children, including teenagers, who are more sensitive 
than adults to air pollution. The activity guidance can 
be found at: https://www.airnow.activity-guides-
publications. A similar guide for PM that includes 
activities for all ages can be found here: https://
www.airnow.gov/publications/activity-guides/
activity-sheet-for-pm.
Air Quality Flag Program. The activity guidance 
can be used with the Air Quality Flag Program. The 
Air Quality Flag Program (https://www.airnow.gov/
air-quality-flag-program/) is a visual way to alert 
schools and other organizations to the local air 
quality forecast. Seeing the flag alerts people about 
the local air quality so that they can take actions to 
protect their health.
Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality 
Response Program and Air Resource 
Advisors
The Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response 
Program (IWFAQRP, https://wildlandfiresmoke. net) 
is an interagency effort led by the U.S. Forest Service 
to provide enhanced information to wildfire 
incidents, agencies, and communities dealing with 
smoke issues. This need for predicting smoke impacts 
associated with wildfires and the role of the 
IWFAQRP was recognized and authorized 
by Congress in 2019. The IWFAQRP has several 
components including tools for enhanced monitoring 
and modeling of smoke; creating consistent smoke 
outlook forecasts in a simple format for sharing 
with the public; and messaging in conjunction with 
state, tribal, and local air quality agencies as well 
as health departments. Much of this work is done 
through the deployment of technical specialists 
called Air Resource Advisors (ARAs) working with 
either wildfire Incident Management Teams (IMT) or 
directly with land management agencies that request 
them as part of wildland fire management efforts. 
Deployed ARAs are a good resource for gaining 
insight into expected fire growth, emissions, and 
impacts. An ARA generally works in the planning 
section of the IMT and consults closely with experts 
in fire weather and fire behavior. ARAs are trained 
to use a variety of smoke dispersion models in 
conjunction with air quality monitoring to help 
build smoke forecasts and information products for 
the public.

Wildland Fire Air Quality 
Response Program supporting an Air Resource Advisor

Incident Meteorologist (IMET), Fire Behavior Analyst 
(FBAN), Safety Officer (SOF), and Public Information 
Officer (PIO).

Air Resource Advisors use a national cache of 
deployable smoke monitors (typically E-SAMPLERS 
and E-BAMS with real-time telemetry capability) 
during wildland fire incidents to provide ground 
information to communities lacking existing 
monitoring capabilities. Enhanced smoke modeling 
including high resolution grids over affected areas 
can be requested of the National Weather Service 
by an ARA. Air Resource Advisor deployments

New monitoring and air quality 
estimation technologies – a caution
In recent years, technology development has 
expanded the variety of information available about 
air quality. These emerging technologies include 
miniaturized PM2.5 sensors stationed in outdoor or 
indoor environments, mobile air quality monitoring 
systems, air quality models that can estimate 
37
concentrations in locations without nearby monitors, 
and data fusion products that blend together 
observational data and models. Still in a research 
phase, but likely to expand over time, are personal 
wearable devices or apps designed to estimate an 
individual’s exposure to PM2.5.
In many areas, these emerging technologies and their 
data are already part of the wildfire smoke dialogue. 
During a wildfire smoke event, communities lacking 
a centrally-located PM2.5 monitor may rely on sensors 
as a primary source of air quality information. 
Citizens, especially those in at-risk groups, might 
make decisions based on localized estimates 
from emerging technologies to mitigate their 
smoke exposure. 
Nevertheless, these data must still be regarded with 
caution. At this writing there are still many unknowns 
concerning the precision, accuracy, and reliability of 
readings from sensors, air quality models, and data 
fusion products, especially in extreme conditions like 
a wildfire smoke event. Although the technology is 
improving, it is important to recognize the limitation 
of using these as stand-alone devices and data 
products without a reference monitor nearby to 
evaluate the new technology’s performance. 
In cases where ARA-implemented monitors or 
official air quality network monitors exist and 
emerging technology is implemented, conflicts in air 
quality information may result. This does not mean 
that either information set is necessarily wrong, but 
reflects differences in the locations measured, how 
data are averaged, or how the AQI is computed. An 
additional cause for disagreement may be error in the 
measurement device or data fusion product.
Therefore, sensor data, models, and data fusion 
products should be considered as supplements to 
a larger package of information to make better 
informed decisions on smoke messaging. Comparing 
sensor data, models, or data fusion products with 
nearby reference monitors can help the public 
official understand how to consider this information 
in their assessment of smoke conditions and 
communications. These new sources of data may 
provide important information on the trends of 
PM2.5, but they need to be put into context with the 
help of nearby regulatory monitors or short-term 
monitors implemented by an ARA, AQI estimates, 
satellite data, and from daily ARA Smoke Outlooks. 
Using visual range to assess smoke levels 
in the interior western United States
Many communities do not have access to continuous 
PM monitoring and may need other ways to 
evaluate local air quality. Visual range (i.e., how far 
can be seen?), like other instantaneous monitoring 
approaches, can inform and help the public respond 
to smoky conditions. This is true even in areas 
that have continuous monitors, because smoke 
concentrations can vary widely within a couple of 
miles and can change rapidly. 
Basic Approach:
To determine visual range, one must:
•	
use this method only during daylight hours,
avoiding sunrise and sunset,
•	
use this method only if relative humidity is less
than 65%,
•	
focus on the darkest object (e.g., black is better
than green),
•	
determine the limit of visual range by looking
for targets at known distances (miles), (the visible
range is the point at which even high-contrast
objects (e.g., a dark forested mountain viewed
against the sky at noon) totally disappear, and
•	
after determining visual range in miles, use Table
3 to identify actions to take to reduce
exposure.
Often, it is difficult to assess “the point at which even 
high-contrast objects (e.g., a dark forested mountain 
viewed against the sky at noon) totally disappear.” 
Instead, it may be more useful to use known 
landmarks at a given distance away to assess possible 
visual ranges. For example, target A is 2 miles away 
and visible, but target B, which is 4 miles away, is 
not visible Therefore the visual range is somewhere

between 2 miles and 4 miles. Use Table 3 to identify 
the range of actions to consider to reduce smoke 
exposure.
Western United States: An important caveat is that 
the above visual range categories only apply in dry 
air conditions typically found in the interior west and 
inland of coastal areas. The combination of water 
and particulate matter in the atmosphere dramatically 
reduces visibility, therefore this method of estimation 
should not be used when relative humidity is greater 
than 65%.
Eastern United States and Higher Humidity 
Locations: Until this approach can be assessed 
for humid conditions, individuals may have to rely 
on common sense in estimating smoke conditions 
(e.g., mild, moderate, heavy smoke) and the kinds of 
protective actions that might be necessary to address 
personal response to the smoke.
Other Considerations: This method of estimating 
a visual range also contains much uncertainty (as 
discussed in Malm and Schichtel, 2013), further 
strengthening the need to use personal judgment 
when assessing smoke conditions. Smoke 
concentrations vary substantially from minute to 
minute. By comparison, continuous monitoring 
devices average their measurements over 1, 3, or 
even 24 hours, so what is seen at a particular moment 
may not be representative of the average reported 
at a nearby monitor. More uncertainty stems from 
sighting on non-black bodies (e.g., green forested 
landmarks, snow-covered peaks), difficulty at judging 
when an object is just barely visible, variations in the 
atmosphere and thickness of the smoke across the 
line of sight, and assuming the atmosphere remains 
constant after using an instantaneous “look” to assess 
conditions. Another commonly occurring problem 
with this method is that the concentration along the 
visual path is not constant, for example, when there is 
little smoke at the surface, but a thick layer of smoke 
aloft and the reference point being used is above that 
smoke layer such that the viewer is looking through 
it. In such cases these methods would be invalid. 
This method is also not effective in early morning or 
twilight hours when the sun is low on the horizon.
The bottom line is that, no matter how far one can 
see, it is always prudent to take measures such as 
those presented in this Guide to protect oneself if 
smoke exposure is a concern.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH
ACTIONS
40
This chapter includes specific guidance to public 
health officials on actions to take to protect the pub­
lic and to advise the public during a wildfire event, 
preparations to make before fires occur, and recom­
mendations for cleaning up after a fire. Because there 
are many factors to consider during a wildfire event, 
these recommendations should be adapted for each 
specific situation. 
Public advisories and protective 
measures
Areas with established air quality programs typically 
have a communication plan for alerting the public 
about air pollution events. A communication plan 
includes details on who should be given specific 
information, when that information should be 
delivered, and what communication channels 
to use to deliver the information. An effective 
communication plan anticipates what information 
will need to be communicated to specific audience 
segments, such as schools or nursing homes. 
One approach is to refer the public to the AirNow 
website (www.airnow.gov), which is used by states 
and most communities across the country. Methods 
for sharing information include state smoke blogs, 
websites, hotlines, press releases, and social media, as 
well as emails and faxes to interested parties (such as 
sports team coaches and daycare providers). Some 
rural areas have used door-to-door dissemination 
of a visibility index (see Table 3) and the associated 
health effects.
Table 4 provides a general list of health effects and 
cautionary statements about altering behavior that 
can be used in public advisories. The advisories are 
based on the AQI, as well as on experience and 
evidence from fire situations. If  only PM10 measurements 
are available during smoky conditions, it can be assumed that 
the PM10 is composed primarily of  fine particles (PM2.5), and 
therefore the AQI and associated cautionary statements and 
advisories for PM2.5 may be used.
Table 5 provides guidance to public health officials 
about measures that can be taken to protect 
public health at different AQI categories and the 
corresponding ambient PM levels. This information 
is intended to help health officials, the media, and 
the general public make decisions about appropriate 
strategies to mitigate exposure to smoke. As 
noted earlier, the official AQI value for PM2.5 for 
the previous day is a 24-hour average of PM2.5 
concentrations measured from midnight to midnight. 
The real-time AQI for PM2.5 reported by the media 
and on AirNow is the hourly estimate of the 24-
hour AQI based on the NowCast. Although Table 5 
provides ambient PM2.5 concentrations and the AQI 
values and descriptors associated with the categories 
(e.g., Good, Moderate), concurrent publication 
of both the AQI values and the ambient PM2.5 
concentrations (in μg/m3) to describe air quality may 
lead to confusion among members of the public. To 
avoid such confusion, it may be preferable to publish 
just the AQI values.
Protecting children
Protecting children is always a high priority in smoke 
events. The factsheet Air Quality and Outdoor 
Physical Activity Guidance for Schools, developed 
jointly by EPA and CDC, provides guidelines about 
when and how to modify outdoor physical activity 
based on the AQI. If a smoke event is forecasted, 
local officials should prepare to implement the 
guidance, including assessing the availability of 
indoor spaces with good indoor air quality for 
children to be active. 
As air quality worsens or is projected to worsen, 
additional protective measures may become 
necessary. These measures could range from allowing 
children with asthma or other medical conditions that 
place them at greater risk from smoke to stay home, 
to closing schools entirely. Several location- and 
event-specific factors should be considered in making 
these decisions. Some of these factors include the 
forecast duration of the event, the relative indoor 
air quality of the homes and schools in the area, and 
the ability to transport children safely to and from 
school. In some locations, indoor air quality may 
be better in schools than in local housing, making 
school closure less beneficial from a public health 
perspective. Indoor air quality in schools should be 
assessed before the start of the fire season to assist in 
planning and decision-making.
41
Protecting other at-risk groups
Protecting members of other at-risk groups, 
including older adults, people with heart or lung 
disease, pregnant women, and people of lower SES, 
is also a high priority for public health officials. 
Maintaining good indoor air quality, using the 
information provided above, is especially important 
in locations where these people are located, such as 
gyms, senior centers, hospitals, or residential facilities 
for older adults. To protect some at-risk groups, 
such as people of lower SES who may live in homes 
without air conditioning or in locations where the 
use of air conditioning may not be common, it is 
advisable to consider setting up cleaner air shelters. 
In addition, it is important to recognize that people 
of lower SES may experience social vulnerability 
due to socioeconomic and demographic factors (e.g., 
socioeconomic status, household composition and 
disability, minority status and language, and housing 
and transportation) that affect the resilience of 
communities (Flanagan et al., 2011). In disasters such 
as wildfires, the socially vulnerable are more likely to 
be adversely affected and less likely to recover. 
In general, individuals in these groups should be 
advised to avoid or limit outdoor activities once air 
quality is characterized as “Unhealthy for Sensitive 
Groups” (orange on the AQI) and to remain indoors 
with windows closed if air quality is categorized as 
“Very Unhealthy” (purple on the AQI). Families 
should consider using an air cleaner with a HEPA 
filter that will help to reduce indoor air pollution, as 
well as to avoid adding particles by smoking tobacco, 
using wood-burning stoves or fireplaces, and candles, 
and only using a vacuum with a HEPA filter.
Protecting outdoor workers
Many workers have jobs that require them to work 
outdoors. Occasionally these workers may be exposed 
to wildfire smoke and other hazards due to wildfires. 
In addition to the workers who are directly involved 
with wildland fire management and suppression, 
there are also workers engaged in supporting fire 
response (e.g., at base camp or evacuation centers) 
or cleanup efforts (e.g., demolition crews) , and 
many others who continue to do their usual non-
fire related outdoor jobs (e.g., agricultural workers, 
landscapers, park personnel) during an incident. 
Similar to the general public, outdoor workers may 
be at risk for adverse health impacts from smoke 
or ash exposure, particularly if they are in an at-risk 
group (described elsewhere in this Guide). However, 
some recommendations made to the public on how 
to reduce their exposures to wildfire hazards may not 
be relevant for outdoor workers who must continue 
to work. In addition, their employers may not have 
anticipated these hazards and may be ill equipped to 
implement effective protections. To better address 
these issues, employers and employees should 
prepare for and plan to implement procedures to 
protect outdoor workers.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) is the regulatory entity for employee health 
and safety but, in about half of the states, a federal 
OSHA-approved state OSHA program regulates 
non-federal workplaces. There are currently no 
occupational standards specifically for wildfire 
smoke, except in California. On July 18, 2019, 
the California Safety and Health Standards Board 
adopted an emergency regulation for a Cal/OSHA 
standard to protect workers from hazards associated 
with wildfire smoke. This standard, Title 8 California 
Code of Regulations Section 5141.1, effective on July 
29, 2019 and will be followed by a process to develop 
a permanent regulation (https://www.dir.ca.gov/
dosh/doshreg/Protection-from-Wildfire-Smoke.
Although healthy adult workers may not be 
significantly affected by short-term exposure to 
smoke or ash while working outdoors, the risk 
of adverse health effects is dependent on the 
contaminant levels, type(s) of material burned, 
duration of exposure, level of physical activity, age 
of the worker, individual susceptibility (e.g., pre-
existing heart or lung disease), as well as other factors 
(see Chapter 1). As a result, responses to exposures 
will vary. 
Employers can take steps to protect healthy as well 
as more at-risk workers from the negative health 
impacts of unhealthy air quality. Some of the same 
recommendations listed in this document for the 
general public can apply when working outdoors 
42
in a smoky environment. Options for limiting 
workers’ smoke exposure include postponing or 
shortening time spent outdoors; focusing on only 
performing high priority tasks; relocating workers or 
rescheduling work tasks to smoke-free or less smoky 
areas or times of the day; reducing outdoor workers’ 
physical activity and exertion levels; encouraging 
and ensuring workers take frequent breaks inside 
cleaner air spaces such as enclosed structures or 
vehicles with recirculating air; and encouraging and 
using air cleaners with HEPA (or other protective) 
filters in indoor working areas to reduce overall 
smoke exposure. 
In some cases, the use of particulate respirators 
should be considered to protect workers who cannot 
implement the exposure reduction recommendations 
listed above when performing outdoor work (see 
additional information below). Workers involved in 
post-fire cleanup activities clearly must be protected 
from exposure to ash and all other hazards (see 
sections pertaining to after-fire hazards) by using a 
range of control methods (e.g., dust suppression, 
personal protective equipment). 
When other measures are not sufficient to control 
a respiratory hazard, OSHA requires employers 
to provide respirators that are appropriate for the 
hazard and work situation. An OSHA-compliant 
respirator program names a qualified person 
responsible for administering the program and 
describes procedures for respirator selection, medical 
evaluation for safe respirator use, fit testing for tight-
fitting respirators, training on topics such as how to 
use and maintain respirators, and program evaluation.
Pre-planning and preparing for how to best 
implement these recommendations in the workplace 
are critical. This is especially true in areas where 
wildland fire smoke exposure is common, and 
workers are required to perform their work outdoors, 
even when the air quality is considered unhealthy, 
very unhealthy, or hazardous. Working together, 
employers and employees can take steps to reduce 
their exposures to the hazards associated with a 
wildland fire. 
Prolonged smoke events
For smoke events that last for more than a few 
days or that occur repeatedly over the course of 
fire season, public health officials should consider 
all options in communicating the importance of 
reducing smoke exposure. Messages should include 
actions individuals can take to reduce smoke 
exposure and should highlight the benefits of 
creating cleaner air spaces in homes. The longer a 
smoke event continues, the more people will start 
to experience adverse health effects. Therefore, 
exposure reduction measures that are recommended 
for short-term exposures to smoke become even 
more important to take with prolonged exposures. 
Prolonged smoke events may require consideration 
of additional measures to protect the public, 
especially people in at-risk groups. 
If they haven’t already, public health officials should 
consider partnering with external businesses, 
agencies, and non-profits to provide spaces with 
cleaner air for the public to go during the day if 
it becomes necessary. These cleaner air spaces 
could include schools, senior centers, libraries, and 
shopping malls. Making spaces with cleaner air 
available during the day can provide an alternative for 
people unable to reduce smoke levels in their homes, 
or unwilling or unable to evacuate to a designated 
cleaner air shelter or out of the area to reduce their 
smoke exposure. Before advertising or advocating for 
these cleaner air spaces, public health officials should 
confirm that the locations have adequate filtration for 
particles. This clean air protection may be provided 
by a MERV 13 or higher filter in the HVAC system 
or a properly sized portable air cleaner with HEPA 
filtration. Building managers should continue to 
ensure that the building is adequately ventilated and 
that fresh air intakes have high-efficiency (MERV 
13 or higher) filters to clean the air entering the 
building. Altering the building pressure balance by 
reducing or stopping air intake could actually create 
indoor air quality issues that could offset any benefit 
of reduced smoke exposure. For more information, 
refer to Appendix D. Cleaner air spaces should also 
43
have institutional controls to limit smoke infiltration, 
such as limited door and window use. Appendix B 
provides some guidelines for creating cleaner air in 
large spaces.
As smoke events continue, stress associated with 
increasing health concerns, loss of control over daily 
activities, reduction in physical activity, and isolation 
resulting from remaining at home indoors can cause 
mental health issues to arise. During a prolonged 
smoke event or repeated smoke events, make cleaner 
air spaces available where people can socialize. One 
beneficial strategy that has been reported consists 
of waiving fees for gym use, which allows people 
to get exercise and interact with others. Be aware of 
mental health issues in your jurisdiction and consider 
creating messages about mental health and available 
mental health services.
Protecting pets and livestock
Many people ask how wildfire smoke affects pets and 
livestock. As with humans, high levels of smoke may 
irritate animals’ eyes and respiratory tract. Animals 
with heart or lung disease are especially at-risk and 
should be closely watched during periods of poor 
air quality. Strategies to reduce animals’ exposure to 
smoke are like those for humans: reduce the time 
spent in smoky areas; if animals are indoors, keep 
indoor air clean; provide animals with plenty of 
water; limit physical activities that will increase the 
amount of smoke breathed into their lungs; and 
reduce exposure to dust or other air pollutants. If 
pets or livestock are coughing or having difficulty 
breathing, the owner should contact a veterinarian. 
Two factsheets, Protect Your Pets from Wildfire 
Smoke and Protect Your Large Animals and 
Livestock from Wildfire Smoke, are available for 
dissemination to the public.
Consider where pets and livestock could be housed 
if the evacuation of people from areas within your 
jurisdiction becomes necessary. For example, in some 
places, local shelters will house pets in carriers and 
it is not uncommon for temporary livestock shelters 
to be created in local fairgrounds or parking lots. 
Animals that are older or have a medical condition 
that increases sensitivity to smoke, may require 
sheltering facilities that can provide cleaner air or 
adequate medical attention. Animal accommodations 
are frequently set up with participation from local 
animal control, humane society or other animal 
rescue groups. For more information, check 
the American Veterinary Medical Association 
(AVMA) website: https://www.avma.org/public/
EmergencyCare/Pages/Pets-and-Disasters.aspx. 
Air quality cautionary statements and 
recommended public actions 
Table 5 shows actions for public health officials 
to consider at the different AQI categories. Public 
health officials may want to recommend some or 
all of the recommended actions associated with 
these categories, based on an assessment of the 
local situation. Some factors that also should be 
considered include:
•	
Predicted fluctuations in PM2.5 levels. Are the
peaks of PM2.5 predicted to occur relatively infre­
quently, interspersed with longer periods of good
air quality, or to occur multiple times per day,
superimposed on higher-than-usual PM2.5 levels?
•	
Predicted duration of  high PM2.5 levels. For
instance, if air quality is predicted to be in the
“Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” range or worse
for multiple days to weeks, public health officials
might consider opening cleaner air shelters or
recommending evacuation plans for at-risk popu­
lations, including individuals with chronic lung or
heart disease, who cannot take adequate personal
protective actions to reduce exposures.
•	
Potential indirect effects. High PM2.5 levels can
impair visibility and increase the risk of traffic
accidents. This may be reason enough to cancel
an evening indoor event at a local high school, for
example.

Keep doors and windows closed, seal large gaps as much 
as possible.
Avoid using exhaust fans (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, clothes 
dryer, and utility room exhaust fans).
Keep the garage-to-home door closed.
If cooling is needed, turn air conditioning to re- circulate 
mode in home and car, or use ceiling fans or portable 
fans (but do not use whole house fans that suck outdoor 
air into the home).
If a home has a central heating and/or air conditioning 
system, install higher-efficiency filters (e.g., filters rated at 
MERV 13 or higher) if they can be accommodated by the 
system. Regardless of whether a filter upgrade has been 
performed, the system’s circulating fan can be temporarily 
set to operate continuously to obtain maximum particle 
removal by the central air system’s filter, although this 
will increase energy use and costs.
Operate appropriately sized portable air cleaners to 
reduce indoor particle levels.
Avoid indoor sources of pollutants, including tobacco 
smoke, heating with wood stoves and kerosene heaters, 
frying or broiling foods, burning candles or incense, 
vacuuming, and using paints, solvents, cleaning products, 
and adhesives.
Keep at least a 5-day supply of medication available.
Have a supply of non-perishable groceries that do not 
require cooking.

1 If only PM10 measurements are available during smoky conditions, assume that the PM10 is composed primarily of fine particles (PM2.5), and that therefore the AQI and 
associated cautionary statements and advisories for PM2.5 may be used.
2 See school considerations in section on Protecting Children, above. Newer schools with a central air cleaning filter may be more protective than older, leakier schools. Also, 
being at school may mean children’s activity levels can be better monitored. It is important to make schools a safe place for children.
3 See Appendix C for guidance.

Public service announcements
This section discusses using public service 
announcements (PSAs) to deliver messages to the 
public in advance of wildfire season. Preparing for 
wildfire season includes planning what actions can 
be taken by individuals well in advance of a wildfire 
smoke event. In areas where fires are likely to occur, 
state and local public health agencies should consider 
running pre-season PSAs or news and social media 
announcements to advise the public on preparing 
for the fire season. The factsheet, Prepare for Fire 
Season, is available on the AirNow website. EPA’s 
webpage Wildfires and Indoor Air Quality also 
provides general information on how to reduce 
exposure to wildfire smoke in residences. PSAs 
should be simple (e.g., “the season for wildfires is 
approaching; take action now to protect your health 
and prepare your home”) and should list a contact 
phone number and website for further information. 
PSAs are also useful during fire or smoke events 
to provide timely updates on the situation, along 
with advice on protective actions. Effective PSAs 
use simple, non-technical messages that people 
can remember, such as “stay indoors” or “limit 
outdoor activities.” News and social media releases 
and website posts should be used to provide more 
detailed information, including information for the 
general public and for people with chronic diseases. 
When wildfire risk is high, the area federal, state, 
tribal, or local land manager is also likely initiating 
a public information campaign to prevent wildfires, 
providing a natural partner for messaging about 
smoke with these agencies.
Consider reaching out to weather forecasters and 
news reporters, who are a valuable resource for 
sharing information with the public. Their role 
as communicators on television, radio, print, and 
online outlets makes them an essential partner 
in any outreach strategy. When reaching out to 
news reporters and meteorologists to “pitch” your 
messages:
•	
Tell them who you are, what agency you repre­
sent, and that your campaign affects the health
and safety of the community.
•	
Make sure they have your contact information, in­
cluding e-mail address, and at least one telephone
number.
General recommendations to the public
General recommendations to the public should 
include at least the following:
1.	 Prepare for wildfire season. Have a several-day
supply of nonperishable groceries that do not re­
quire cooking, since cooking (especially frying and
broiling) can add to indoor pollutant levels. Have
extra medications, such as asthma medicine. For
more information for the public about steps to be
ready – use the Prepare for Fire Season factsheet.
2.	 If you develop symptoms suggesting lung or
heart problems, consult a health care provider as
soon as possible.
3.	 Be alert to local announcements, air quality fore­
casts, and changing smoke conditions.
4.	 Be aware that outdoor events, such as athletic
games or competitions, may be postponed or
canceled if smoke levels become elevated.
5.	 During a wildfire smoke event, you can take
steps to limit smoke infiltration and clean the air
indoors with either the right-sized portable air
cleaner with true HEPA filtration or a HVAC
filter with a MERV rating 13+. See the EPA web­
page Wildfires and Indoor Air Quality.
48
Recommendations for people with chronic 
diseases
Recommendations for people with chronic diseases 
should include at least the following:
1.	 These recommendations are for people with
chronic diseases, including heart or lung disease.
Have an adequate supply of medication (more
than 5 days).
2.	 People with asthma should have a written asthma
action plan. Check the EPA website for resources
on asthma action plans: https://www.epa.gov/
asthma/asthma-action-plan
i.	 People with heart or lung disease should check
with their health care providers about precau­
tions to take during smoke events. They should
do this prior to the fire season if they live in an
area that has the potential for wildfires.
ii.	 Contact a health care provider if your condi­
tion worsens when you are exposed to smoke.
iii.	
When using one or more portable air cleaners,
buy air cleaners that are appropriately sized for
the intended rooms, as specified by the manu­
facturer, before a smoke emergency occurs. Be
sure they are certified by California as low-or-
no ozone models by checking the California Air
Resources Board website at https://www.arb.
ca.gov/research/indoor/aircleaners/certified.
htm.
iv.	A news release could also include recommen­
dations for preparing residences to keep smoke
levels lower indoors, and on the appropriate
use of respiratory protection, as discussed
above. See factsheets on Indoor Air Filtration
and Protect Your Lungs from Wildfire Smoke
or Ash, the webpage Wildfires and Indoor Air
Quality, and Appendices B and D.
Use social media to raise awareness
Social media outlets, such as Twitter, Facebook, and 
Instagram, are a good way to raise awareness about 
wildfire smoke health protection. Keep in mind that 
you have many different audiences, so you will need 
to use many different media to share messages about 
smoky conditions in your community. 
For information on how to use social media for 
health messages, visit the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention Health Communicator’s Social Media 
Toolkit: https://www.cdc.gov/socialmedia/tools/
guidelines/socialmediatoolkit.html.
Social media can attract and direct the public to 
a central website or document for distribution. 
This central website will provide complete wildfire 
smoke information. For social media success, post 
simple messages that reflect the community’s needs 
at the time. Post different messages but always 
copy and paste the same link to direct the public to 
your webpage with the most complete, up-to-date 
information. Repeating the link to a central website 
is a good way to reach out and make more people 
aware of the information. 
Prior to wildfire smoke season, create a template 
with a simple graphic element that is repeated on the 
central webpage and use the same look for any other 
wildfire smoke announcements, such as paper flyers, 
email, and social media, so that when the public sees 
it they will immediately recognize the information. 
Make the template usable in both electronic and print 
media. This can be something as simple as the health 
department or local government logo and a heading 
such as WILDFIRE SMOKE ALERT. 
Social media messages, like any messages, require 
advance planning. You will want to find the right 
contact in your office or agency who oversees social 
media, ask them about the process for approving and 
posting messages, propose messages they can send 
out in a timely fashion, and evaluate the effectiveness 
of messages delivered over social media.
In the off-season, you can share messages from 
other sites by retweeting or sharing the information 
49
previously posted on a reputable social media site 
such as the CDC or EPA. Messages can include 
topics such as brush cleanup around the perimeter of 
a home. You can look to the following resources to 
find messages to share:

Preparedness
Preparation is key to effective response to wildfire 
smoke events. In the months leading up to fire 
season, the National Significant Wildland Fire 
Potential Outlooks (https://www.predictiveservices.
nifc.gov/outlooks/outlooks.htm), developed by 
the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), can 
give an idea of the predicted severity of the coming 
months of the fire season. These assessments 
indicate which areas of the country are likely to see 
various levels of fire activity and are designed to 
inform decision makers for proactive wildland fire 
management. Outlooks are available for the current 
month, the month following and a seasonal look at 
the two months beyond that. However, long-range 
predictions can be uncertain. Also, even if the NIFC 
is predicting normal or below normal fire activity in 
your region, you may be downwind of an area that is 
likely to see heightened activity.
Before wildfire season arrives, public health officials 
should consider taking some or all of the following 
steps, especially if they are in an area predicted to 
be a higher risk of fire. This is a simple list, more 
detailed information about each of these steps can be 
found other places in the Guide. 
Recommended steps for public health officials 
before fire season
Recommended steps for public health officials in 
areas likely to experience smoke to take before fires 
start include: 
1.	 Check fire risk level in monthly outlooks at Na­
tional Interagency Fire Center  (NIFC) website
and, especially if high, communicate risk to the
public.
2.	 Consider how to implement the recommended
actions in Table 5 above.○
○
Identify locations that could serve as cleaner
air shelters.○
○
Identify locations that could serve as cleaner
air spaces.○
○
Check indoor air quality (IAQ) capabilities in
places where at-risk populations congregate
(e.g., schools, preschools and daycares; senior
centers and nursing homes) and investigate
approaches to improving IAQ, if necessary.○
○
Have supply of NIOSH-approved respirators
to disseminate to public; consider approaches
to supplying portable air cleaners.
3.	 Prepare a communication plan.○
○
Include approaches for quick dissemination of
information to the public (e.g., social media).○
○
Include approaches to reach members of at-
risk populations.○
○
Develop messages about mental health and
available mental health services, since stress
can cause mental health issues to arise.○
○
Inform public about steps to be ready - use
Prepare for Fire Season factsheet.
4.	 Form partnerships with important partners or
stakeholders, for example: air quality agencies,
local health providers, the media and others.○
○
Help local health providers learn about the
health effects of smoke and the populations at
greatest risk using the EPA and CDC continu­
ing education course about particulate matter,
Particle Pollution and Your Patients’ Health.
50
After the fire, the effectiveness of the response 
to a wildfire smoke event should be assessed so 
needed improvements can be identified. A season-
ending discussion with partners and preparation 
of a “lessons learned” plan or report will help the 
partnership continue to grow and improve. 
Build strong partnerships
Wildfires can start and spread rapidly, and a smoke 
event may descend on a community in a matter 
of hours. Ideally, relationships between health 
departments, air quality agencies, land management 
agencies, and other partners will be in place before 
a crisis begins. To reduce potential public confusion, 
partner agencies responding to a wildfire smoke 
episode need to begin working together right away 
to inform the public of smoke and health risks using 
consistent messages. A pre-existing partnership 
enables a rapid response to a serious smoke episode 
and allows everyone to quickly access and share vital 
information.
All agencies working on fire and smoke response 
should coordinate closely during the incident to 
ensure consistent communications and to leverage 
resources for developing and delivering information 
to the public. This can be achieved through steps 
such as cross-linking websites, and clearly directing 
public and media inquiries to the appropriate agency 
and subject matter experts. Some agencies may have 
the best experts for media interviews while another 
may have easy access to language translation services. 
One partner may be able to access communication 
material design experts while another contributes 
monitoring data analysis experts. Building a team 
that capitalizes on agency and individual strengths 
while breaking down agency boundaries is the most 
effective way to quickly serve the public in an air 
quality emergency. 
Physicians and other health care providers often 
have a high degree of credibility with the public. 
Having a good working relationship with local 
health providers who are knowledgeable about the 
health effects of smoke can be very useful in getting 
health and exposure reduction information out to 
the public through the media. EPA has developed 
an on-line training course, Particle Pollution and 
Your Patients’ Health (https://www.epa.gov/
pmcourse), to educate health providers about the 
effects of particulate matter. The training includes 
a section on high-particulate matter events, such 
as wildfires, that is consistent with the information 
and recommendations in this guide. Physicians, 
nurses, and health educators can receive continuing 
education credits from CDC for taking this online 
training. 
Remember that while working with local media and 
posting information online is important, it is not the 
only way to deliver information during an emergency. 
Other methods are effective such as posters, door 
hangers, fliers, or radio and television. Note that 
smoke and messaging needs frequently cross state 
and international boundaries so coordination needs 
to be developed beyond typical jurisdictions.
Putting together a wildfire smoke team 
Responding to the needs of the public in case of a 
serious or prolonged wildfire smoke event will be 
far more effective if relevant state, local, and federal 
agencies and organizations are engaged and working 
together as a team. Some states have ad hoc wildfire 
smoke response teams that have already formed 
during wildfire smoke response efforts, other states 
or areas may need to start at the beginning to find 
and engage partners. Some states have prepared 
formal emergency smoke response plans that outline 
local points of contact, responsibilities of state 
agencies and other cooperators, and instructions for 
acquiring extra needed resources such as monitors or 
masks. In some states when wildfire smoke impacts 
are serious or prolonged, these agencies and other 
local cooperators hold daily or as-needed conference 
calls to share information and coordinate air quality 
messaging and public outreach efforts. Participating 
in these internal calls can be very valuable for public 
health agencies. Possible key partners in a public 
response effort include:
•	
State and local clean air agencies – State and
local clean air agencies are expert at accessing and
summarizing local air monitoring data and often
have the ability to forecast upcoming
51
meteorology and dispersion conditions that will 
affect smoke movement and accumulation. State 
air agencies often work with the National Weath­
er Service to have air pollution advisories issued 
when needed. 
•	
Federal and state land management agen­
cies – Typically, federal or state land management
agencies have the lead in wildfire suppression and
response. Any ARAs working in the area are likely
assigned either to a wildfire incident management
team or to a Federal Agency Administrator. ARA’s
are a very valuable source of information for the
public health community and can help spread
public health messages through ongoing com­
munications. ARA efforts are improved through
consultation and coordination with state public
health entities. To see if an ARA is working in an
area check www.wildlandfiresmoke.net.
•	
Incident management teams assigned to large
wildfires are expert at connecting with local
communities and frequently host public meetings
where smoke and appropriate public responses
may be discussed. These meetings can be an ex­
cellent forum for ARAs and public health agen­
cies to deliver messages about smoke and public
health.
•	
Tribes – Many tribal communities run their own
air quality programs and have local information
about supplemental monitors and effective out­
reach to their communities. EPA regional offices
assist with tribal air programs. Federal agencies
can help provide information to tribes if a fire is
on, or smoke is affecting, lands in Indian coun­
try. Federal agencies have a trust responsibility to
tribes and have established contacts who can help
deliver information on wildfire smoke and health.
•	
State and local public health agencies – State
and local health agencies are expert at communi­
cating health risks and protective actions in sim­
ple language the public can understand and are
well linked to organizations,such as assisted living
facilities, hospitals, and clinics, that serve at-risk
groups. Public outreach needs of public health
agencies often mean they have language transla­
tion expertise so important health messages can 
reach non-English speakers.	­­­		­
•
EPA regional offices and the Wildland Fire Air
Quality Response Program may have por-table
air quality monitors that can be deployed to
smoky areas that are not well represented by
existing state networks. The Wildland Fire Air
Quality Response Program website (www.wild-
landfiresmoke.net) also provides tools to help
summarize monitoring data from state moni-
toring networks and from emergency monitors
deployed to wildfires.
•
School systems – School administrators are
frequently anxious for advice on how to best
protect their students from smoke. Schools can be
invaluable channels for accessing not only
children but entire families, particularly in regions
where children may be more literate in English
than older family members. In addition, schools
can sometimes serve as temporary shelters for
evacuees.
•
Faith-based and community-based organi-
zations – Faith-based and community-based
organizations can help disseminate awareness
messages and can potentially serve as partners for
sheltering evacuated residents.
Cleaning up after the fire
Even after the worst of the fire and smoke is 
over there remain health and safety hazards that 
homeowners should be aware of. Exposure to 
lingering smoke and ash from a wildfire can cause 
significant health effects in both healthy individuals 
and those in at-risk groups. People may experience 
symptoms including respiratory irritation, heat-
related illness, and even emotional stress after a fire. 
Physical stress from cleanup activities, exposure to 
toxic chemicals, damaged power lines, and equipment 
such as portable generators can cause injuries during 
clean up. To learn more about the health and safety 
hazards that people might encounter after a wildfire, 
refer to Appendix E.

Even after the fire is out, smoke and ash residue can 
affect the air quality in affected structures. Depending 
on the severity of smoke intrusion into the building 
and the length of exposure, some people may notice 
a lingering odor when they return to their homes, 
schools, or places of work. Removal of smoke odor 
is difficult, but there are ways to diminish the odor, 
including beginning with a thorough airing of any 
structure. If conditions permit, windows and doors 
can be opened and fans can be placed in rooms to 
circulate the air. If it is too warm or cold to open the 
doors and windows, a large portable air cleaner that 
has a high-efficiency filter (HEPA) can be used to 
ventilate the rooms and promote air exchange to help 
remove the odors. Any air cleaner used should meet 
ozone emissions and electrical safety requirements. 
Approved air cleaners can be found here: https://
www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/aircleaners/
certified.htm. Note that while HEPA filters will 
remove lingering fine particles in the air, they do 
not remove the gaseous chemicals that cause odors 
associated with wildfire smoke. These chemicals must 
be removed by using a portable air cleaner with an 
activated charcoal prefilter or a prefilter composed 
of alumina coated with potassium permanganate and 
replacing the prefilter frequently. Most prefilters on 
smaller portable air cleaners will saturate quickly and 
lose effectiveness in a smoky environment. Portable 
air cleaners with more robust odor removal are 
available but are frequently on the higher end of the 
price spectrum. 
In addition to ventilation, it is also important to 
thoroughly clean the affected space. Every surface 
of the space that was exposed to smoke will need 
to be cleaned. If ash or other hazards are present, 
individuals performing cleanup work should wear 
protective clothing and equipment, such as a well-
fitting N-95 respirator, leather gloves, safety glasses 
or goggles, long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and 
shoes with rugged soles. Cleaning will include wiping 
down the walls, floors, windows, baseboards, doors, 
frames, cabinets, furniture, and other surfaces with 
a dilute solution of water and soap. Some people 
may choose to use additional cleaning products; 
however, it is important to note that some cleaners 
also impact indoor air quality. Those who choose to 
use additional cleaning products should be advised 
to read label instructions carefully and follow 
all instructions. Curtains, rugs, furniture covers, 
bedding, and anything that can be safely washed in 
a washing machine can be cleaned in this manner. 
Carpets will also need to be cleaned. This can be 
done professionally or by using a carpet cleaner 
rented from a local market or rental center. Often 
the building ductwork for the heating and cooling 
system will not be an issue because in many cases 
the power goes out during fire events and the AC 
systems do not circulate smoke- and ash-filled air 
through the ductwork for very long. In cases where 
ductwork does have smoke residue and is a source 
of odors, it is recommended to consult with a local 
smoke remediation company or HVAC contractor to 
see what options are available to clean it. EPA has a 
guide for consumers on duct cleaning: https://www.
epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/should-you-have-air-
ducts-your-home-cleaned. 
The use of an ozone generator to remediate smoke 
odor is not recommended because ozone can create 
as many problems as it is intended to fix. Many 
of the chemicals that are broken up by ozone can 
produce byproducts that are also dangerous to health. 
Furthermore, ozone does not remove ash and other 
particles from the air and indoor surfaces. If an 
ozone generator is used to remove smoke odors it 
should be used only by a remediation professional. 
The space where the ozone generator is being used 
must be unoccupied during, and for a designated 
period after, its use to be sure that no one is exposed 
to the ozone. Finally, some companies claim to use 
“hydroxyl” generators for remediation. Hydroxyl 
radicals are highly reactive and can also create 
chemical byproducts. These devices should be used 
with the same caution as ozone generators.

APPENDIX B
Identification and Preparation of Cleaner Air Shelters for Protection 
of the Public from Wildfire Smoke
1. Identify one or more facilities with tight-sealing windows and doors and public access (for example, librar-
ies, school gymnasiums, buildings at public fairgrounds or civic auditoriums). As a rule of thumb, newer
buildings will generally be more desirable than older ones. Consider using institutional controls to limit
smoke infiltration, such as limited door and window use.
2. At a minimum, a cleaner air shelter should have central air conditioning with filtration that is at least medi-
um or high-efficiency, particularly at the fresh (outdoor) air intake(s). If needed, filters should be upgraded
prior to the fire season after assuring that the system can handle the increased airflow resistance. Building
managers should ensure that filters are properly fit and sealed to prevent air bypassing the filter media.
Filters should be regularly maintained and/or replaced according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Even during smoke events, building managers should continue to ensure that the building is adequately ven-
tilated and that fresh air intakes have high-efficiency (MERV 13 or higher1) filters to clean the air entering
the building. Reducing or stopping fresh air intake could actually alter the building air-pressure balance and
create indoor air quality issues that could offset any benefit of reduced smoke exposure (for more informa-
tion, refer to Appendix D.
3. Install/inspect room air cleaners where appropriate, such as in cleaner air shelters with separate, smaller
rooms (e.g. classrooms, meeting rooms). Choose room air cleaners with sufficient capacity, i.e., a tobacco
smoke Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) that is at least 2/3 the room volume. Choose an air cleaner with
a higher CADR for rooms with ceilings higher than 8ft. Ensure proper maintenance of air cleaners, keep
spare filters on hand, and provide instructions on changing the filter to trained personnel.
4. Assure that the facility can handle the increased cooling load due to high occupancy.
5. Install a properly calibrated carbon monoxide alarm that has a digital display and battery backup function
(available at most hardware stores).
6. Provide a radio for updates on fire status and access to a telephone in case of emergency.
7. Ensure adequate services such as restroom facilities and garbage disposal/collection.

Accessing Information about Active Wildfires
It’s often difficult to obtain information about brand new or emerging wildfires and good information may 
take a day or two (or longer) to become available. Until then, the best way to get a little news on a new wildfire 
may come from scanning social media posts from state fire management agencies, county sheriff departments, 
and county emergency management. Local news is often quickly onsite and can be another source of 
information. The National Interagency Fire Center hosts a map that shows various incidents around the US 
including satellite detected hot spots which may show the location and size estimate of a new wildfire. The 
map can be accessed here: https://maps.nwcg.gov. 
Once a wildfire grows to the point that local fire response agencies can no longer manage it, an Incident 
Management Team will be ordered. Information on a wildfire is much easier to find once one of these 
teams has arrived. Detailed information about wildfires can be accessed at the Incident Information System 
(INCIWEB): https://inciweb.nwcg.gov. Geographic area coordination centers (GACC’s) have more localized 
information about wildfires and are another good source of information. Access your local GACC here: 
https://gacc.nifc.gov/index.php.

Seeing Smoke from Space
Satellites are continually viewing the planet and 
often see large wildfires and the smoke emanating 
from them. Satellite views can help determine where 
smoke is coming from. Is it from a near-by fire, or is 
it from Canada or even Siberia? It’s important to note 
that the smoke seen from a satellite may be anywhere 
in the atmosphere, so it could be elevated and not 
affecting people at ground level. Clouds can generally 
be distinguished from smoke as they show up as 
bright white whereas smoke is off-white or beige with 
a brownish tinge. NASA WORLDVIEW provides 
access to satellite photos: https://worldview.
earthdata.nasa.gov. An optional overlay layer of “fires 
and thermal anomalies” shows the locations of large 
fires as red spots (Figure C1)
Sometimes satellite pictures are difficult to interpret, 
such as when smoke mixes with clouds. Then a 
human analysis is useful, such as the NOAA Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke plume product. The 
analysis tells you where smoke is light (green), medium (yellow), or heavy (red). The Current Fires page on the 
AirNow website uses shades of gray to display the smoke plumes from the NOAA HMS (Figure C2).
AirNow-Tech 
AirNow has a decision support tool called AirNow-Tech (airnowtech.org), which allows partner agencies 
to manage, quality control, query, and visualize not only their data but also a national dataset of air quality, 
meteorological and satellite information. One powerful AirNow-Tech tool for wildfire evaluation is Navigator 
GIS. Navigator allows the user to overlay meteorological, fire, and satellite data over air quality observations. 
In addition, users can run trajectories on any point of the display to see air parcel projections or for post 
wildfire event analysis (Figure C3).

U.S. Forest Service/Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program Tools
The U.S. Forest Service Research AirFire Team and the Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program have 
developed a number of tools and on-line resources to aid in summarizing monitoring data and 
making smoke dispersion predictions. These tools, plus others under development, are available here: 
https://wildlandfiresmoke.net/tools. These are some of the fundamental tools used by Air Resource Advisors 
assigned to wildfires.

can select monitors from a map and view time-series data in a number of plots showing daily averages, hourly 
NowCast values, and diurnal smoke impact patterns. Multiple monitors of interest can be selected, and once 
selected bookmarking the site’s URL allows users to share this list with others or to quickly return to this 
specific set of monitors and view updated air quality measurements.
Currently the tool displays fine particulate measurements (PM2.5), but other pollutants may be added in the 
future. The tool uses public data made available from EPA’s AirNow-Tech system (https://airnowtech.org), 
monitoring data from a national cache of temporary monitors that are deployed during wildfire incidents, plus 
any additional monitoring data made available by originating agencies as long as the source data has not been 
tagged as “private”2 (Figure C4). 
BlueSky Daily Smoke Model Runs 
Predicting air quality impacts from active wildfires depends on linking together information and models to 
estimate fire size, fuel type, fuel consumption, smoke plume rise, weather, atmospheric dispersion, and ground-
level smoke concentrations. One commonly used smoke tool developed by the Forest Service AirFire Research 
team is the BlueSky smoke modeling framework. Multiple versions of BlueSky run automatically each day with 
daily updates of fire and weather information. BlueSky combines basic fire information with available fuels 
maps (from the USFS Fire Characteristic Classification System [FCCS]) and current fuel moisture conditions 
(from the USFS Wildfire Information Management System [WIMS]), to compute fuel consumption (via the 
USFS CONSUME model) and emissions before computing plume rise and dispersion. Two different plume 
and dispersion models are used - a simple LaGrangian dispersion model with no chemistry (HYSPLIT), and the 
Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ). CMAQ is run in two modes; limited chemistry, 
or as a full photochemical model with all sources. Multiple geographic domains, weather models, weather 
model resolutions, and dispersion models combine to result in approximately 30 separate iterations for a user to 
choose from (Figure C5). All runs can be accessed at https://tools.airfire.org.
BlueSky relies on meteorological models with high resolution grids in order to better estimate local smoke 
effects. Currently the most fine-scale meteorological models used by BlueSky on a daily basis have a resolution 
of 1.33 km enabling predictions of smoke movement to reflect the effects of complex terrain (Figure C6). 
High resolution versions of BlueSky are available for the Pacific Northwest, California/Nevada, Arizona, and 
Alaska. National grids at 3-km resolution are available, as are combined Canada/CONUS grids. Movable, 
high-resolution meteorological grids (1.27 km) can be placed over areas of concern during the western wildfire 
season when made available by the National Weather Service. All model runs are viewable on a simple web map 
with options for 1-hour, 3-hour, and daily (24-hour) smoke estimates. Typical forecasts extend for 2–3 days into 
the future. KMZ files for use in Google Earth are available for download. 
2 Occasionally states set up special purpose monitoring studies where the data is not publicly available.

APPENDIX D
Guidance on Protecting Workers in Offices and Similar Indoor Workplaces from 
Wildfire Smoke (Adapted from Cal/OSHA)
Wildfire smoke can be a hazard for people who work in office and commercial buildings many miles from 
evacuation zones. Environmental and public health agencies have advised people to consider setting air 
conditioners in their homes to recirculation mode, if possible, in order to reduce the intake of pollutants. 
Subsequently, people have asked whether to apply this advice to limit the introduction of outdoor air 
applies to office and commercial buildings. Eliminating or substantially reducing the outdoor air supply in 
office buildings and other indoor workplaces as a first step to reduce exposure to smoke is generally not 
recommended.
The ventilation systems in office buildings and other commercial buildings are more complicated than home 
air-conditioning systems. Changing the outdoor air supply in public and commercial buildings can adversely 
affect other essential functions of the building. These buildings typically have heating, ventilating and air 
conditioning systems (HVAC systems) that bring outside air into the building through filters, blend it with 
building return air, and thermally condition the air before distributing it throughout the building. These 
buildings also have exhaust air systems for restrooms and kitchens, and may also have local exhaust systems for 
garages, laboratory fume hoods, or other operations. These exhaust systems require makeup air (outdoor air) in 
order to function properly. Also, without an adequate supply of outdoor air, these systems may create negative 
pressure in the building. Negative pressure will increase the movement of unfiltered air into the building 
through any openings, such as plumbing/sewer vents, doors, windows, junctions between building surfaces, or 
cracks. In general, buildings should be operated at slight positive pressure in order to keep contaminants out, 
and to help exhaust air systems function properly.
HVAC systems should be operated continuously while occupied in order to provide the minimum quantity of 
outdoor air for ventilation, as required by the standards or building codes to which the building was designed. 
For many office buildings, this is often in the range of 15–20 cubic feet per minute (cfm) per person, although 
it could be less in older buildings.3
Using the HVAC System(s) to Protect Building Occupants from Smoke
As a first step to protect building occupants from outdoor air pollution, including the hazardous conditions 
resulting from wildfire smoke, building managers and employers should ensure that the HVAC system’s filters 
are not dirty, damaged, dislodged, or leaking around the edges. Before the wildfire season, or during smoke 
events if necessary, employers and building operators should ensure that a qualified technician inspects the 
HVAC systems, makes necessary repairs, and conducts appropriate maintenance. Filters should fit snugly in 
their frames, and should have gaskets or sealants on all perimeter edges to ensure that air does not leak around 
the filters.
Building operators should consider installation of the highest efficiency filters that do not exceed the static 
pressure limits of the HVAC systems, as specified by the manufacturer or system designer4. Pressure gauges 
3	Cal/OSHA regulations (8 CCR 5142) require that HVAC systems be operated continuously while occupied in order to provide the minimum quantity of outdoor air 
required by the state building code at the time the building permit was issued. These regulations are currently found in the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Section 
121. For most buildings, this quantity is 15 cubic feet per minute (cfm) per person.
4	Many existing HVAC systems should be able to accommodate pleated, medium-efficiency filters with particle removal ratings of MERV 5 to 12, and some may be able 
to use high-efficiency filters with ratings of MERV 13 or higher. Consider a low-pressure HEPA filter (MERV 17 plus) if the building occupants have respiratory or heart 
D-2
should be installed across the filter to indicate when the filter needs replacing, especially in very smoky or dusty 
areas. Indoor contaminants can be further reduced by using stand-alone high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) 
filtering units. For more information on air cleaners, see the California Air Resources Board webpage at: 
https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/aircleaners/consumers.htm.
In some circumstances it may be helpful to reduce the amount of outdoor air in order to reduce smoke 
pollution inside the building, while still maintaining positive pressure in the building. Temporary reductions in 
outdoor air flow rates might be considered when all of the following conditions are met:
1.	 The local outdoor air quality for particulate matter meets the EPA Air Quality Index definition of Un­
healthy, Very Unhealthy, or Hazardous due to wildfire smoke.
2.	 A qualified HVAC technician has inspected the HVAC systems and ensured that the filters are functioning
properly, that the filter bank is in good repair, and that the highest feasible level of filtration has been pro­
vided. This should be documented in writing.
3.	 A qualified HVAC technician or engineer has assessed the building mechanical systems and determined, in
writing, the amount of outside air necessary to prevent negative pressurization of the building, and to suf­
ficiently ventilate any hazardous processes in the building (such as enclosed parking garages or laboratory
operations).
4.	 The HVAC systems are operated continuously while the building is occupied to provide at least the mini­
mum quantity of outdoor air needed, as determined by the HVAC technician or engineer in Item 3 above.
The employer or building operator ensures that the systems are restored to maintain the minimum quantity of 
outdoor air for ventilation, as required by the standards or building codes to which the building was designed, no 
later than 48 hours after the particulate matter levels fall below the levels designated by the EPA as Unhealthy. 
Other Actions to Protect Employees from Wildfire Smoke
In addition to assessing and if necessary modifying the function of the HVAC system, employers are 
encouraged to take other reasonable steps to reduce employee exposure to smoke, including alternate work 
assignments or relocation and telecommuting. Some buildings rely on open windows, doors, and vents for 
outdoor air, and some may have mechanical ventilation systems that lack a functioning filtration system 
to remove airborne particles. In these cases, the employees may need to be relocated to a safer location. 
Employees with asthma, other respiratory diseases, or cardiovascular diseases, should be advised to consult 
their physician for appropriate measures to minimize health risks.
Respirators, such as N95s and other filtering facepiece respirators, may provide additional protection to some 
employees against environmental smoke. Employees whose work assignments require the use of respirators 
must be included in a respiratory protection program (including training, medical evaluations, and fit testing). 
Additional Information
The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has produced a multi-page summary on air cleaning and its effects 
on health and perceived air quality, which can be found at: https://iaqscience.lbl.gov/air-summary

APPENDIX E 
Hazards during Cleanup Work Following Wildfires from National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
The purpose of this section is to discuss some of the health and safety hazards that homeowners and workers 
may encounter after a wildland fire. This document is not designed to address health and safety for fire fighters 
or other emergency response workers during a wildfire or other emergency event.
After a wildfire has ended, cleanup and recovery activities are often needed. These activities may pose 
health and safety hazards that require necessary precautions. In most cases, it may be more appropriate for 
professional cleanup and disaster restoration companies, rather than homeowners or volunteers, to conduct 
this work. Although the types of hazards may be different for each wildland fire, some common hazards 
include:
1.	 Contact with fire.
After a wildfire, trained fire fighters will make sure the fire is completely out. If there is any chance the
wildfire could reignite, leave immediately and notify emergency personnel.
2.	 Burnt and unstable structures.
Be aware of unstable and damaged houses and other structures after a wildfire. Do not assume that these
areas are safe or stable because damage may not be noticeable and can create a risk for serious injuries from
slips, falls, punctures, or being struck by collapsing materials.
Safety Measures
To prevent injuries from burnt and unstable structures:
•	 Conduct a thorough inspection and identify and eliminate hazards before conducting any work. Avoid
work around fire-damaged structures, including stairs, floors, and roofs, until an engineer or architect
examines and certifies the structure is safe.
•	 Wear personal protective equipment, including long sleeved shirts and pants, hard hats, safety glasses,
leather gloves, and steel toe boots, to reduce the risk of injury.
•	 Leave immediately if a structure shifts or makes an unusual noise that could signal a possible collapse.
3.	 Burnt and unstable trees. Another common hazard after a wildfire is unstable trees, known as ‘snags’ or
‘hazard trees,’ which can fall and injure homeowners and workers. It is important to assess the stability of
all trees before working and driving around them.
Safety Measures
•	 Always contact a professional to evaluate a tree’s stability and to safely remove any suspected hazardous
trees from the property and along roadways before conducting cleanup work.
•	 For more information about potential hazards from tree removal, see: Preventing Chain Saw Injuries
During Tree Removal After a Disaster (https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/chainsaws.html).
E-2
4.	 Carbon monoxide.
•	 Wildland fire cleanup activities may involve the use of gasoline or diesel powered pumps, generators, and
pressure washers. This equipment releases carbon monoxide (CO), a deadly, colorless, odorless gas. It is
important that homeowners and workers protect themselves from CO poisoning.
      Safety Measures
      To avoid the risk of CO poisoning:
•	 Never bring gas or diesel powered machines indoors.
•	 Only operate these machines in well-ventilated areas.
•	 Do not work near exhaust gases (CO poisoning can occur even outdoors near exhaust from engines that
generate high concentrations of CO).
•	 Shut off the equipment immediately and seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of CO
poisoning.
•	 To learn more, visit NIOSH’s webpages: Carbon Monoxide (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/co-
comp/) or Carbon Monoxide Hazards from Small Gasoline Powered Engines (https://www.cdc.gov/
niosh/topics/co/).
5.	 Confined spaces.
A confined space is an area that has limited openings for entry or exit, has limited air flow and is not de­
signed for human occupancy. Examples of confined spaces include septic tanks, storage tanks, utility vaults
and wells. These spaces may contain toxic gases, may not have oxygen, or may be explosive. In many cases,
these hazards are not easily recognized without proper training and equipment.
Safety Measures
•	 Never enter a confined space without proper training and equipment, not even to rescue a fellow worker.
Contact the local fire department for help.
•	 To learn more, visit NIOSH’s webpage: Confined Spaces (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/confined­
space/).
6.	 Fatigue and stress.
A homeowner may experience emotional stress and mental and physical fatigue from cleanup and from
loss of personal property or valuables. Fatigue and stress may increase the risk of injury and illness.
Safety Measures
After a fire, homeowners or other workers may need to:
•	 Seek emotional support from family members, neighbors, and local mental health care workers to help
prevent more serious stress-related problems.
•	 Set priorities for cleanup tasks and pace work over days or weeks to avoid physical exhaustion.
•	 Rest and take frequent breaks to avoid exhaustion.
•	 Begin a normal sleep and eating schedule as quickly as possible.
•	 Take advantage of disaster relief programs and services in the community.
•	 Understand physical and mental limitations.
E-3
•	 To learn more, visit NIOSH’s webpages: Traumatic Incident Stress: Information For Emergency Re­
sponse Workers (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet643.html) and Stress at Work
(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/stress/).
7.	 Electrical dangers.
One common danger after a fire is a downed/damaged power pole with potentially energized power
lines laying on the ground or hanging from the pole. Any type of work with power lines or other electri­
cal sources must only be conducted by trained professionals, such as electricians and utility workers. If a
potential electrical danger or a downed power line is identified, avoid all electrical hazards by stopping work
and immediately notifying the local utility company.
Safety Measures
When working near power lines, it is important to follow these steps to prevent electrical injuries:
•	 Do not work or enter any area with any potential for electrocution from a power line or other electrical
hazards.
•	 Treat all power lines and cables as energized until proven otherwise.
•	 When the power is off, never restore power until a professional inspects and ensures the integrity of the
electrical system.
•	 Do not use electrical equipment that has been exposed to heat from a fire until checked by an electrician.
•	 Unless power is off, never enter flooded areas or touch electrical equipment if the ground is wet.
•	 Use extreme caution when equipment is moved near overhead power lines. For example, contact between
metal ladders and overhead power lines can cause serious and often fatal injuries.
•	 Do not stand or work in areas with thick smoke. Smoke hides electrical lines and equipment.
•	 To learn more, visit NIOSH’s Electrical Safety page: (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/electrical/).
8.	 Hazardous and other potentially dangerous materials.
Many homes and other structures may contain or store hazardous materials and chemicals. Some common
materials include asbestos, lead, pesticides, propane, and gasoline. These materials may cause health effects,
may be explosive, or may react with other chemicals. Before beginning cleanup activities, contact a profes­
sional who is familiar with hazardous materials to determine the different types of hazards that are present
and how to safely clean up and dispose of them in accordance with local and state laws.
Safety Measures
To reduce the chance of exposure to hazardous and other dangerous materials:
•	 Be cautious of chemicals, propane tanks, and other dangerous materials.
•	 Wear protective clothing and gear when handling hazardous materials.
•	 If exposed to hazardous materials, wash the affected area (e.g., skin, eyes) and contact your local poison
control center or the American Association of Poison Control Centers at 1 (800) 222-1222. Seek medical
care immediately if the exposure is severe or you experience symptoms.
•	 Homes built before 1980 may contain asbestos and lead. Contact your county health department to learn
about local laws and regulations. Because disturbing lead and asbestos may result in serious health con­
sequences, it is recommended that only trained professionals test for and clean up materials that contain
lead or asbestos.
E-4
•	 Fires may also damage tanks, drums, pipes, or equipment that may contain hazardous materials, such as
pesticides, gasoline, or propane. Before opening or removing containers that may contain hazardous ma­
terials, contact the local fire department or a hazardous materials team to help assess and remove hazard­
ous waste.
•	 To learn more about chemical safety, visit NIOSH webpages: Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards
(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/) and Chemical Safety (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/chemi­
cal-safety/default.html).
9.	 Hot environments.
While working in hot weather, homeowners and cleanup workers could be at risk for heat-related illnesses,
such as heat stress, heat rash, heat cramps, and heat stroke. It is important to be aware of the symptoms of
heat related illness, how the illness can affect health and safety, and how it can be prevented.
Safety Measures
To reduce the potential for heat related illnesses, it is important to follow some basic work practices,
such as:
•	 Wearing lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes,
•	 If possible, blocking out direct sun or other heat sources,
•	 Taking frequent breaks in cool, dry areas,
•	 Acclimatizing before working (getting used to weather conditions),
•	 Working during the cooler hours of the day when possible, and
•	 Maintaining hydration by drinking plenty of water and other fluids.
•	 If a homeowner or worker displays any signs of heat related illness, it is important to immediately go
to a cool, shaded place, sit or lie down, and drink water. If possible, cool water may be poured over the
homeowner’s or worker’s head and body. Seek medical attention immediately if the symptoms do not
subside.
•	 To learn more, visit NIOSH’s webpage: Heat Stress (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/).
10.	 Musculoskeletal injuries.
Homeowners and workers who may be involved in cleanup activities are at risk for developing stress, strain,
and potential musculoskeletal injuries, which are injuries or disorders of the muscles, nerves, tendons,
joints, cartilage, or spinal discs. These common injuries can occur when moving debris and materials, using
hand-held equipment (e.g., chainsaws) due to repetition, force, vibration, or awkward postures.
Safety Measures
Some useful tips to prevent these injuries:
•	 Use teams of two or more to move bulky objects.
•	 Take breaks when conducting repetitive work, especially if experiencing fatigue.
•	 Avoid working in unusual or constricting postures.
•	 Use correct tools and equipment for the job and use them properly.
E-5
•	 Do not lift material weighing 50 pounds or more and use automated lifting devices for heavier objects.
•	 Be sure the area is clear of slip, trip and fall hazards.
•	 To learn more, visit NIOSH’s webpage: Ergonomics and Musculoskeletal Disorders (https://www.cdc.
gov/niosh/topics/ergonomics/).
11.	 Wildfire smoke and ash
Smoke from a wildland fire can pose health risks. Older adults, young children or individuals with underly­
ing heart or lung disease are the most likely to be affected by inhaling wildland fire smoke. Healthy indi­
viduals may also experience short-term respiratory irritation symptoms, such as burning eyes and runny
nose. If there is smoke in the area, homeowners and cleanup workers who are at-risk of experiencing a
smoke-related health effect should consider leaving the area until the smoke clears.
Ash from wildland fires can be deposited on indoor and outdoor surfaces in areas around the fire and can
be irritating to the skin, nose and throat, and may cause coughing.
Safety Measures
To minimize the health effects that may occur due to exposure to smoke and ash:
•	 Always wear proper personal protective equipment (long sleeve shirts, pants, gloves and safety glasses)
when working around ash. If you do get ash on your skin, wash it off as soon as possible.
•	 Do not use leaf blowers or take other actions (e.g., dry sweeping) that will put ash into the air. Shop vac­
uums and other common vacuum cleaners do not filter out small particles, but rather blow the particles
out the exhaust into the air. To clean up ash, use vacuums equipped with High Efficiency Particulate Air
(HEPA) filters.
•	 Do not consume any food, beverages, or medication that has been exposed to burn debris or ash.
•	 Well-fitting respirators may provide some protection during cleanup. Please visit NIOSH’s Respirator
Trusted-Source Information web site at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_
part/RespSource.html.
•	 If the presence of asbestos, lead, CO or other hazardous material is suspected, do not disturb the area.
Dust masks or filtering facepiece respirators do not protect against asbestos or gases such as CO.
•	 Avoid burned items that may contain hazardous chemicals, such as cleaning products, paint and solvent
containers.
•	 Avoid ash from wooden decks, fences, and retaining walls pressure treated with chromated copper arse­
nate (CCA) as it may contain lethal amounts of arsenic.
12.	 Working with and around heavy equipment.
Do not operate heavy equipment, such as bulldozers, backhoes, and tractors, unless you are properly
trained. Serious and fatal injuries can occur when equipment is used improperly. To learn more about
motor vehicle safety, visit NIOSH’s webpages: Motor Vehicle Safety (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/motor­
vehicle/default.html) and Fatality Assessment Control and Evaluation (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/
default.html).
13.	 First aid
First aid, even for minor cuts and burns, is extremely important as workers are exposed to smoke and
burned materials. For more information, please visit NIOSH’s webpage: NIOSH’s First Aid Procedures
(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/firstaid.html).
