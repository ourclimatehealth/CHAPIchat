HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Health Impacts of 
Climate Change
Climate change threatens the fundamentals that sustain life and health—fresh water, food, clean air, 
shelter, and security—and thus threatens the health and possibly the very survival of the communities 
that local health departments serve. Climate change is a global phenomenon, but it is people 
and communities at the local level that experience its consequences. Climate change exacerbates 
local and global health inequities because some people and communities bear an unfair burden 
of these health harms, including low-income communities, communities of color, native and tribal 
communities, the very young and very old, and those with chronic illnesses. This Section provides an 
overview of the health impacts of climate change.

4.1 Extreme Heat
The CDC deﬁnes extreme heat as “summertime temperatures that are substantially hotter and/or 
more humid than average for that location at that time of year.”1 Climate change increases extreme 
heat exposure.
Climate Change Worsens Extreme Heat
• 
Seventeen of the country’s eighteen warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.2
•
In 2017, periods of extreme heat broke state records throughout the summer and fall. Every state had an 
annual average temperature that was warmer than usual.3 Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
and South Carolina had the warmest year on record.4 There has been a dramatic increase in hot night-
time temperatures in the U.S., reducing critical hours of relief during heat waves.5
• 
Different regions of the U.S. are expected to see varying levels of temperature increase due to climate 
change; average temperature is projected to increase by 3–5°F by the mid-2030s and 2.8–10.8°F by the 
end of the century.6 See Figure 4.1.1.

Health Impacts of Extreme Heat
Heat already causes more deaths than any other natural disaster.8  
• 
From 1999–2010, 7,415 people died from heat-related illness in the U.S., an average of 618 per year.9 
Extreme heat results in excess death and illness through heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and exacerbation of 
chronic illness. In addition, heat exposure triggers multiple physiological mechanisms that cause damage 
to the brain, heart, intestines, kidneys, liver, lungs, and pancreas.10 
• 
Increased ozone levels from extreme heat exacerbate asthma, respiratory disease, and cardiovascular 
disease.11  
• 
Heat stress and associated dehydration can exacerbate renal disease and may be linked to new epidemics 
of chronic kidney disease.12 
• 
Exposure to extreme heat impacts mental health through increased incidence of disease, death, violence, 
aggression, suicide and higher rates of admission for those with a psychiatric condition. Persons with 
mental illness may have triple the risk of death during a heat wave.13 In the U.S., there is an association 
between periods of extreme heat and increased rates of violent crimes in cities.14  
• 
Some medications are sensitive to heat and may lose effectiveness or cause harmful side effects when 
exposed to heat.15 Other medications alter individual tolerance to extreme heat, increasing the risk of  
heat illness.16 
• 
Heat waves contribute to crop and livestock loss, resulting in rising food prices and increased food 
insecurity.17,18   
Extreme Heat and Health Equity
• 
Urban heat islands: Low income and communities of color are more likely to be located in “urban heat 
islands”—dense urban areas with fewer trees, less green space, more buildings, higher energy use, and 
more impervious asphalt and concrete. These characteristics create urban heat islands where nighttime 
temperatures may be as much as 22°F higher than surrounding areas. These vulnerabilities often map 
onto areas of historical residential segregation.19 
• 
Race and ethnicity: As of 2013, African Americans were 52% more likely, Asian Americans 32% more 
likely, and Hispanics 21% more likely to live in heat vulnerable areas of the U.S. compared with non-
Hispanic Whites.20  
• 
Rural communities: The risk of heat-related mortality may be about 3% higher in rural areas when 
compared to urban areas, potentially linked with less access to health care services, greater proportions 
of elderly people, many outdoor occupations, fewer media to share heat information, and less access to 
air conditioning and transportation.21  
• 
Working conditions: Outdoor farmworkers are at greater risk of exposure to extreme heat, and 
from 1992–2006, heat-related deaths were 20 times higher among crop workers than the general U.S. 
population.22 Occupational heat stress and chronic dehydration may lead to chronic kidney disease in 
outdoor workers.23

LHD Spotlight: 
Cooling Centers in Maricopa County, Arizona 
In 2005, 35 individuals died over a 9-day period of extreme heat in Maricopa County.29 MCDPH 
partnered with the Arizona Department of Health Services and Arizona State University to evaluate 
community access to and perceptions of cooling centers by surveying facility visitors and managers 
and observing use during an extreme heat event. 
There are 58 private and public cooling centers in Maricopa County—locations that are air-
conditioned or cooled and have been designated as a site individuals can go to during heat 
events.30 The evaluation found that many cooling centers were open only on weekdays, primarily in 
community centers, senior centers, and religious institutions without clear or visible signs notifying 
the public of the availability of a cooling center.31 Eighty-four percent of visitors were unemployed, 
33% had no permanent residence, and 11% of those who indicated a permanent residence had no 
air conditioning at their place of living.32  
Maricopa County subsequently developed a Heat Relief Regional Network—a partnership of 
municipalities, nonproﬁt organizations, and faith-based organizations—to mitigate heat health 
risks. The Network maintains a list of cooling centers and services on available maps and hosts 
trainings on heat illness prevention for facility managers.33
• 
Social isolation: Social, cultural, and linguistic isolation are all risk factors for heat illness.24 In the 
European heat wave of 2003, elders living alone had the highest mortality rates.25  
• 
Physical or cognitive impairments: Limited mobility increases the risk of isolation, and the ability to 
move to a cooler location. Cognitive impairment may limit the ability to recognize risk or seek assistance 
during an extreme heat event.
• 
Age: The very young and the elderly are less able to sense and adapt to changes in temperature, due to 
limitations in body temperature regulation.
• 
Chronic Illness: Those with conditions such as obesity, diabetes or renal, cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases are at higher risk of heat illness, including exacerbation of complications related to their 
underlying illness.26 
• 
Air Conditioning Access: A 2005 study found that African American households had 5.3% higher heat-
related mortality rate than White households, and had half the access to central AC.27 
• 
Evolving Extreme Heat Geography: People living in some regions of the U.S., such as coastal 
communities, may be especially vulnerable to extreme heat because they are not currently acclimatized 
to increased temperatures but will experience increased high heat days.28

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
What Local Health Departments Can Do 
See Sections 6—Programs and 7—Functions
Assessment and Surveillance
• 
Conduct a heat vulnerability assessment for your jurisdiction:
 
Use available data to identify and map vulnerable populations, neighborhoods with 
characteristics that increase temperatures, and the location and availability of cooling centers. 
 
Share this information with partners including health care providers and institutions, community 
based organizations, schools, emergency management agencies, and social services agencies.
 
Share this information with residents and community-based organizations to foster awareness of 
heat illness prevention and to elicit suggestions for steps the community and local agencies might 
take to address heat vulnerability.
 
Use the heat vulnerability assessment to demonstrate the need for preferential greening in tree 
and park poor neighborhoods, urban heat islands, and areas with high numbers of people with 
individual or household risk factors for heat illness.
• 
Initiate heat illness syndromic surveillance and partner with local health care facilities to implement 
reporting on heat-related illness (See the Section 7.1—Surveillance).
World Health Organization’s 
Core Elements of Heat–Health Action Plans43
1. Agreement on a lead body to coordinate a multi-purpose collaborative mechanism between 
bodies and institutions and to direct the response if an emergency occurs.
2. Accurate and timely alert systems.  
3. A heat-related health information plan (what is communicated, to whom and when). 
4. A reduction in indoor heat exposure, including medium- and short-term strategies and advice 
on how to keep indoor temperatures low during heat episodes. 
5.
Particular care for vulnerable population groups. 
6. Preparedness of the health- and social-care systems (staff training and planning, appropriate 
health care and the physical environment). 
7. Long-term urban planning to address building design and energy and transport policies that 
will ultimately reduce heat exposure. 
8. Real-time surveillance and evaluation.

HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Intersectoral Collaboration 
Collaborate with parks, public works, sustainability ofﬁces, and community groups to support and fund the 
expansion of green space and green infrastructure that reduces ambient temperatures and provides access to 
cooler spaces, including tree canopy, parks, water features, and urban streams. 
• 
Ensure preferential planting of less allergenic trees and plants.34 
• 
Implement cool and green roofs programs and support related rebates for homes and businesses.35  
Following are example recommendations for intragency initiatives to combat heat:
• 
Provide shading for transit stops, bike lanes, and sidewalks; provide access to cooling buses by working 
with transit agencies and public works.36 
• 
Collaborate with law enforcement and emergency services to train police and ﬁrst responders to 
recognize heat-related illness in vulnerable populations and ensure that heat response plan includes 
strategies to reach homebound individuals.
• 
Ensure that local codes require facilities such as assisted-living establishments monitor and automate air-
cooling systems to remain within comfortable temperatures in all living and communal areas.37  
• 
Establish relationships with local OSHA ofﬁcials and employers to ensure that outdoor workers and 
others vulnerable to heat are informed, and that employers are aware of their responsibilities to prevent 
occupational heat-related illness, especially providing plenty of drinking water, shaded cool areas, and 
extended breaks for workers.38 Adjust work schedules to reduce physical demands during the hottest 
times of day.39 
• 
Use home visits to assess housing conditions and vulnerability of household members, provide 
heat health information, and make referrals to social service agencies and programs that provide 
ﬁnancial support (rebates, bill-paying subsidies) for services that could prevent heat-related illness (air 
conditioning, tree planting, weatherization).
 
Work with utilities and other agencies to inform residents about and ensure enforcement of 
“disconnection rules” that prohibit electricity cut-offs.40 
 
Connect clients and communities to resources for ﬁnancial support in coping with heat, such as 
Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).41 
• 
Work with housing and social service agencies to integrate extreme heat assessments and education into 
home visiting programs.
Prepare for Extreme Heat Events
Implement early warning systems for extreme heat events by collaborating with local weather forecasters to use a 
standard terminology for heat health and agree on the threshold used. In addition, consider the following:
• 
Broadcast extreme heat conditions with information on preventing heat illness, checking on neighbors 
and family members, and access to cooling centers.
• 
Set up a phone line and webpage in multiple languages with information on cooling centers and heat 
illness prevention. Ask the media to publicize these outlets.

• 
Contact local facilities that serve vulnerable populations (e.g. nursing homes, senior centers, schools and 
child care providers, homeless services) to ensure protocols for extreme heat are in place and facilities are 
prepared for activation.
• 
Establish and evaluate cooling centers to assess the availability of cooling centers and cool sites in your 
jurisdiction. Ensure there is adequate outreach to communities and vulnerable populations informing 
them of facilities and cooling sites open during extreme heat events. 
 
Work with public agencies and local businesses to make more air conditioned spaces available 
for extended hours during extreme heat events and make sure that cooling site facilities have 
adequate power to continue air conditioning. 
 
Survey visitors and facility managers of cooling centers to evaluate services, utilization, capacity, 
and accessibility, including via public transit.42 
Community Engagement and Education
Integrate climate change in materials and media messages for the public to increase awareness that climate 
change is a health issue. Here is an advisory from a webpage warning of extreme heat and health issues:
Extreme Heat
Original: Hot and humid summer weather can cause heat illness and even death. More 
Americans die from heat waves than all other natural disasters combined.44
Modiﬁed: Hot and humid summer weather can cause heat illness and even death. As 
climate change causes increasing temperatures around the world, our area can expect to 
experience more heat events like this. More Americans die from heat waves than all other 
natural disasters combined.
 
29
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Conduct public awareness campaigns in multiple languages and via various media to educate 
communities about strategies to reduce neighborhood heat and prevention of heat illness. See the CDC’s 
Tips for Preventing Heat Illness for more information.45  
• 
Inform clients to check with their doctor about medications that increase the risk of heat illness 
(e.g. psychotropic medications, diuretics, tranquilizers, some medications for Parkinson’s disease) and 
whether prescribed medications (e.g. insulin) may lose effectiveness if exposed to high temperatures. See 
Polk County, Iowa’s medications and heat handout for an example.46  
• 
Educate local clinicians on the health impacts of heat and how they can protect patients and community 
health during extreme heat, and provide materials for patient waiting rooms. See A Physician’s Guide on 
Climate Change, Health and Equity.

From Surveillance  
to Engagement: Maricopa 
County Department of 
Public Health 
Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) engaged with diverse partners to host a series of 
workshops, Bridging Climate Change and Public Health, elevating the health and equity impacts of climate 
change for numerous partners. 
Maricopa County might be considered “heat central” in the U.S. Phoenix, the largest city in the county, has 
an average of 110 days with temperatures over 100°F and 19 days over 110°F. Average daily temperatures in 
the Southwest are projected to rise 2.5–8°F by 2100. Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) 
conducts surveillance of heat illness, including syndromic surveillance. From 2006 to 2014, Maricopa County 
experienced 691 heat-associated deaths. A 2015 rapid epidemiologic assessment of households revealed that 
although 95% of residents have central air conditioning, high electricity and maintenance costs prevent many 
from using it. 
MCDPH maintains public cooling centers and hydration stations throughout heat season, and partners with 
community organizations to promote their use and warn the public about heat risks. Although the 2015 Maricopa 
County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan identiﬁed the likelihood of increased intensity and duration of 
extreme heat days due to climate change, MCDPH did not refer to climate change in its public communications 
on heat. 
MCDPH recognized that the homebound population is exceptionally vulnerable to extreme heat, and in early 
2016 launched a project to assess their needs. In partnership with the Area Agency on Aging, the City of 
Phoenix Home Delivered Meals program, Arizona State University (ASU), and Maricopa County Human Services 
Department, MCDPH created a survey that was distributed to homebound individuals by meal delivery staff. 
Of the 1300 surveys distributed, 472 people responded. The survey identiﬁed the need to increase awareness of 
heat-related services, simplify the process for obtaining services, and make transportation to cooling centers more 
accessible for homebound individuals.
From Surveillance to Community Engagement
In November 2016, MCDPH convened a wide array of stakeholders for the ﬁrst “Bridging Climate Change and 
Public Health” summit. MCDPH presented the results of the homebound survey and information on impacts 
of climate change on extreme heat and health. With 45 participating organizations, it set the stage for further 
discussion about collaborative efforts to address the challenges of climate change. Staff found a very high level 
of receptivity to the discussion. “Most importantly, we no longer hesitate to use the term climate change—it has 
proven to be much more acceptable in our community than we had anticipated.”
31
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Following a second summit in May 2017, 
MCDPH convened stakeholders to develop a 
formal Bridging Climate Change and Public 
Health Strategic Plan for Maricopa County. In 
a series of three meetings, community partners 
identiﬁed ﬁve strategic directions, including:
• 
Celebrate incremental success and 
climate and health champions.
• 
Promote community awareness and 
public education about climate and 
health.
• 
Foster environmental and climate 
action for a healthier community.
• 
Coordinate research and collaborative 
efforts to catalyze change.
• 
Develop a strategic and targeted 
communication plan. 
Future Work
MCPDH has received funding from the Arizona 
Department of Health Services Building 
Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) 
program that will be used to implement the 
ﬁrst Strategic Plan action step. Celebrating 
Success and Champions, will recognize Climate 
and Health Champions—local youth, citizens, 
schools, organizations, or businesses that are 
implementing sustainable solutions and/or 
ecofriendly practices or policies that promote 
health in the face of climate change. MCDPH 
sees the recognition of positive action as one 
more way to spread awareness about climate 
and health in Maricopa County.

4.2 Drought
Climate Change Increases Drought Frequency and Intensity 
Drought is a deﬁciency of rainfall over a period of time, resulting in a water shortage for some activity, group, or 
environmental sector.1 Climate change is increasing the frequency, severity, and duration of droughts: A NASA 
analysis found that, with current greenhouse gas emission trends, the Southwest and Central Plains of the U.S. 
have an 80% likelihood of megadroughts that could last decades between the years 2050 and 2099 (Figure 4.2.1).2 
 
•
With emissions cuts, the chance of megadroughts in these regions decreases to 60%.3
• 
While the U.S. Dust Bowl in the 1930s lasted a decade, NASA analyses have found that future droughts 
throughout the U.S. may last at least 30 to 35 years, resulting in the driest periods of these regions in the 
last 1,000 years.4,5   
• 
Water consumption and withdrawal of water from surface and underground water aquifers is increasing, 
and leading to greater pressure on limited water resources.6

Health Impacts of Drought
People need water to drink, cook, grow food, and for sanitation and hygiene. Severe drought may reduce water 
access (including through strict conservation measures) so that water for these purposes is limited. Drought can 
cause these health risks:
• 
Lower crop yields and increased crop loss contribute to rising food prices and amplify food insecurity, 
associated with increased risk of chronic diseases.8  
• 
The affects of drought on physical health, food security, economic livelihood, social stability, and forced 
migration can have serious mental health impacts.9 
• 
Drought can increase the concentration of industrial chemicals, heavy metals, and agriculture runoff 
contaminants in groundwater, increasing the risk of toxic exposure if communities increase reliance on 
groundwater sources as surface water diminishes. 
• 
As communities draw on groundwater, land sinking puts infrastructure like roads, aqueducts and levees 
at risk of permanent damage.10  
• 
Drought increases over-pumping of groundwater that contributes to seawater intrusion and increased 
groundwater salinity11 (See Section 4.6—Sea Level Rise).
• 
Dry vegetation and increased heat from drought are associated with more frequent wildﬁres, which have 
widespread health impacts (See Section 4.3—Wildﬁres).12  
• 
Drought increases the risk of infectious and vector-borne disease. The risk of Valley Fever increases 
as soil dries out and dust is dispersed in the air.13 Due to increased household water collection during 
drought, increased pools of stagnant water in storm water and sewer pipes can bring mosquitoes closer 
to human populations and increase vector-borne disease transmission.14 As animals seek water, they and 
the insects they host may move closer to where people live, increasing the likelihood of human exposures 
(See Section 6.2—Infectious Disease).15
• 
Due to crop loss and lower yields, drought can cause displacement and mass migration for agriculture 
workers. By 1940, the Dust Bowl had forced 2.5 million people out of the Plains states.16  
34
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Drought and Health Equity 
• 
Poverty: Those with limited ﬁnancial resources are vulnerable to food and water insecurity from rising 
food and water prices associated with drought and crop loss.17 
• 
Agricultural Workers: Farmers and communities are more vulnerable to the adverse economic impacts 
of drought, and to the mental health impacts.18  
• 
Rural Communities: Poor rural communities are disproportionately reliant on small water systems or 
private drinking water wells, and thus at increased risk of water shortages or exposure to contaminated 
well water.19 
• 
Tribal Communities: Native communities are already facing impacts of long-term drought on their 
agriculture and livestock, springs, medicinal and culturally important plants, and drinking water 
supplies.20 Native communities are more likely to lack access to clean, potable drinking water than other 
groups in the U.S.21 
• 
Chronic Illness: Lack of safe drinking water can exacerbate pre-existing renal disease.22 Food insecurity is 
associated with higher risks of chronic illness such as diabetes and hypertension (See Section 4.8—Food 
Security).
• 
Race and Ethnicity: African American and Filipino populations are at increased risk of contracting dust-
related Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever).23 Eighty percent of U.S. farmworkers identify as Hispanic, and 
this group is more vulnerable to economic impacts of extended periods of drought.24 
What Local Health Departments Can Do 
See Sections 6—Programs and 7—Functions
Assessment and Surveillance
• 
Work with water utilities and other agencies to conduct a drought vulnerability assessment.33 
 
Assess climate impacts on likelihood of drought, the projected impact on agriculture/farming, 
inventory of well owners, community water sources, water pricing, and water insecurity.
 
Identify vulnerable populations and community assets.
 
Monitor water price increases and assess impacts on low-income residents.
 
Scale mosquito monitoring to correspond to changes in precipitation and identify where nesting 
sites may proliferate due to drought.
 
Increase groundwater and surface water quality monitoring during drought for increased 
concentration of contaminants and increased salinity in areas at risk of saltwater incursion.
• 
Survey households using the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) 
methodology to understand the drought’s impact on household water use, water access, conservation 
behaviors, hygiene, work, budgets, and health to plan programming and response to needs of your 
jurisdiction (See Section 7.1—Surveillance).34 
• 
Enhance monitoring of water quality and contamination during drought.35 
35
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Intersectoral Collaboration 
• 
Work with local water agencies/suppliers to develop protocols to ensure that water price increases do not 
lead to water shutoffs that impact health and well-being. 
• 
Work with local water agencies and suppliers to prepare community drinking water delivery plans 
to supplement drinking and hygiene supplies in vulnerable areas.36 Provide alternate water supplies, 
including hauled water and bottled water. 
• 
Collaborate with parks and recreation, public works, and community groups to support rain water 
catchment and grey water reuse.
LHD Spotlight: Understanding the Impacts of Drought 
in Tulare County, CA25
Tulare County, California is a rural agricultural community in California’s San Joaquin Valley and 
may be a harbinger of what increased drought looks like. As the worst California drought in 
recorded history lingered on, private wells in Tulare County started to run dry. By November 2015, 
1,308 wells had run dry, affecting over 6,000 residents.26  
• 
Thousands of agricultural workers lost their jobs as thousands of acres of farmland were 
fallowed. 
• 
Local food banks and other services were overwhelmed.
• 
Local emergency rooms reported a 25% increase in respiratory disease visits.27  
•
The community saw a rise in illnesses such as West Nile Virus and Valley Fever and twice the 
statewide rate of diarrheal disease in 2013.28,29
• 
Throughout the county, there were rising levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental 
health concerns.30  
To better understand how the drought was impacting communities within its jurisdiction, 
the Tulare County Health and Human Services (TCHHS) Agency partnered with the California 
Department of Public Health’s Division of Environmental and Occupational Disease Control to 
survey residents using the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) 
methodology. TCHHS representatives went door-to-door within clustered regions of the county 
to gather responses to a survey assessing 1) household demographics, 2) drought knowledge and 
practices, 3) water access and use, 4) conservation practices, 5) related employment and health 
impacts, and 6) emergency communication preferences.31 This informed TCHHS about vulnerable 
communities in their jurisdiction and how to improve drought-related communications. 
Many of the residents surveyed were undocumented and were thus afraid to report that their taps 
had run dry, providing TCHHS with vital information on vulnerability within the community to 
improve their outreach efforts. In some communities, a third of the households requested Spanish 
for emergency communications. These surveys highlighted potential entry points for programmatic 
action, such as improving conservation behaviors or ensuring better hygiene practices.32
36
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
 
Educate community members about safe and healthy water conservation. 
 
Ensure water from community rain barrels is clearly marked for non-potable uses and ensure 
individuals installing home rainwater systems are informed about safe usage.
 
Promote the use of screens and other mosquito deterrents for water storage vesicles to prevent 
the spread of mosquito-borne illness.
• 
Work with local water agencies to assess permit requests for new wells or requests to dig existing wells 
deeper to prevent additional draws on local water resources in drought prone areas.37 
• 
Support improvement of existing water systems to ensure adequacy of access to safe and clean drinking 
water, such as: establishing connections to adjacent public water system, replacing or rehabilitating wells, 
increasing access to temporary treatment systems.
Prepare for Droughts
• 
Prepare for an inﬂux of public health service requests with prolonged drought.38 Anticipate extra 
resources for vector control.
• 
Collaborate across agencies and community groups to build support for initiatives that protect ever more 
precious water from contamination (e.g. nitrate contamination policies, reducing pesticide use) to reduce 
the likelihood of enhanced contamination.39 
Community Engagement and Education
• 
Integrate mentions of climate change in materials and media messages for the public, to increase public 
awareness that climate change is a health issue. Opportunities include public health alerts, health 
advisory announcements, and educational materials and campaigns related to drought. For example:
Drought
Original: Drought can cause signiﬁcant mental health impacts on residents, especially in 
rural communities that depend upon farming and ranching as a basis of economic support. 
Risk of stress, depression, suicide, and substance abuse may increase during a drought.40
Modiﬁed: Drought can cause signiﬁcant mental health impacts on residents, especially in 
rural communities that depend upon farming and ranching as a basis of economic support. 
Risk of stress, depression, suicide, and substance abuse may increase during a drought. 
California is likely to experience extended periods of drought in coming decades due to 
climate change.
• 
Conduct public awareness campaigns—in multiple languages and via various media—and educate clients 
and communities on the rising risks of drought due to climate change, health risks associated drought, 
and how to prevent them, including: 
 
Use language-appropriate outreach to inform residents of available drought assistance, including 
behavioral health, public health, and food assistance services.41  
37
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
 
Disseminate information on water conservation during routine facilities inspections and  
home visits.42 
 
Communicate the importance of hand hygiene and educate clients on alternatives that can be 
used when water is limited.43 
 
Discuss how prolonged drought may increase West Nile Virus incidence and how to avoid 
transmission: use of insect repellent, clothing, window screens, destruction of breeding habitat, 
avoiding outdoors during peak hours. 
 
Educate communities on Valley Fever and how to avoid transmission: avoiding areas and 
activities with high dust exposure (construction or dusty ﬁelds, gardening, etc.), staying indoors 
with windows closed on windy and dusty days, and ensuring good indoor air ﬁltration.
 
Educate communities about how to access and wear respirators, such as an N95 mask if activities 
in areas with poor air quality cannot be avoided. 
 
Discuss the social and psychological impacts of drought and refer clients to mental health services.
• 
Provide well owners with information on testing wells more frequently during drought when there is less

Fireﬁghters During Idaho Wildﬁre 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012 
4.3 Wildﬁres
Climate Change Increases Wildﬁre Risk
Climate change causes higher temperatures, earlier snowmelt, and drier conditions that increase the frequency, 
intensity and duration of wildﬁres, as well as the length of wildﬁre seasons in the U.S.1 
• 
Wildﬁre seasons are expected to be longer and stronger across the U.S. by 2050.2 High ﬁre years are likely 
to occur 2–4 times per decade by 2050, instead of once per decade, as was the average before 2010.3  
• 
Increasing development at the wildland-urban interface places more homes and people at risk. In 2015, a 
USDA study assessed vulnerability in “wildland/urban interface” and found almost one-third of the U.S. 
population lived in the most vulnerable areas to wildﬁres.4 
• 
Warmer temperatures and precipitation changes associated with climate changes are contributing to 
growth in bark beetle populations, leading to millions of dead trees across Western forests.5 Unhealthy 
forests may contribute to more intense wildﬁres.6  
Wildﬁres Worsen Climate Change
Wildﬁres contribute to global warming by releasing massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and reducing 
the amount of forest available to sequester carbon.7 Up to 3% of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come 
from wildﬁres.8 Western forests are important carbon sinks, capturing 20–40% of U.S. carbon emissions.9 The 
EPA estimates that U.S. wildﬁres emitted around 164.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015, growing 
substantially from previous years, and accounting for 2% of the country’s annual CO2 emissions.10 
Health Impacts of Wildﬁres
• 
Wildﬁres are a major source of particulate matter (PM).18,19 PM exposure increases the risk of 
cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses, and wildﬁres increase the risk of premature death, 
exacerbated asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, and negative birth outcomes from PM exposure.20 
39
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Wildﬁre smoke can travel long distances and 
affect the health of people far downwind of 
the ﬁre. Smoke from the 2002 wildﬁres in 
Quebec caused a 30-fold increase in PM2.5 
in Baltimore, MD, which is nearly 1,000 
miles downwind,21 and pollutants from a 
2004 Alaska wildﬁre were found in Europe.22 
Air quality in surrounding regions can also 
remain poor for weeks.23  
• 
Wildﬁres also increase exposure to carbon 
monoxide, ground level ozone and toxic 
chemicals released from burning building 
materials or used to ﬁght the ﬁre.24 
• 
Indoor air quality is impacted as smoke 
penetrates into homes, which is where the 
majority of exposure to wildﬁre particulate 
matter occurs for individuals sheltering in 
place.25  
• 
Wildﬁres cause immediate harm through 
burns, traumatic injury, smoke inhalation, 
and heat stress; wildland ﬁreﬁghters are at 
particularly high risk.26,27    
• 
Soil erosion and runoff from wildﬁres can 
contaminate water supplies far downstream 
from the ﬁre site, negatively impacting the 
quality, quantity, and availability of safe 
freshwater supplies.28  
• 
Wildﬁres can leave soils damaged and 
vulnerable to extreme erosion, which can 
lead to dangerous ﬂooding and mudslides if 
heavy rains impact the area after the ﬁre.29  
• 
Wildﬁres burn everything in their path, including dangerous chemicals (e.g. in pesticides, propane, 
gasoline, plastic, and paint) that can burn down to ash with very high concentrations of any toxic 
components.30 Clean-up workers may be at highest risk of exposure.
• 
Wildﬁres stress health care and public health systems, including skilled nursing facilities, with 
evacuations, increased medical visits, and the need for emergency response resources. 
• 
The stress, displacement, and loss of home and community associated with wildﬁres can cause 
signiﬁcant mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD.31 
Western Wildﬁres in 2017
• 
Wildﬁres burned 9,781,062 acres across the 
U.S., the 3rd largest acreage burned in a 
year in U.S. records, killing 54 people and 
costing over $18 billion in damage.11,12    
• 
In Montana, a total of 2,420 ﬁres burned 
1.4 million acres, surpassing the previous 
record set in 2012 for the most area burned 
in the state for over 100 years.13 
• 
In the fall, dozens of wildﬁres across the 
Paciﬁc Northwest blanketed the region in 
thick smoke, creating states of emergencies 
in many areas.14 
• 
There were 7,117 ﬁres in California that 
burned 505,956 acres, more than double 
the previous ﬁve-year average (202,786 
acres).15 
•
Five of the twenty most destructive 
wildﬁres in California history occurred 
in 2017.16
• 
Fires across Southern California in 
December burnt away vegetation, leaving 
soils vulnerable to ﬂooding and erosion. In 
January 2018, heavy rains in these areas led 
to dangerous ﬂooding and mudslides that 
killed more than 20 people.17

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Wildﬁres and Health Equity
• 
Age: The very young and the very old are more sensitive to the air quality impacts of wildﬁres. For 
children, their developing respiratory systems make them vulnerable to long-term impacts of wildﬁre 
smoke, particulates, and ground level ozone. 
• 
Place: Communities and households at the wildland-urban interface where human-built environments 
are adjacent to areas of wildland vegetation are at greater risk of wildﬁres.32 
• 
Socioeconomic Status: Low-income households are less likely to have disaster insurance and have fewer 
resources to cope with or rebound from home and property loss or temporary displacement.
• 
Race and Ethnicity: African Americans have higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease that 
increase sensitivity to the health effects of smoke.
• 
Tribal Communities: Native American and Alaska Native populations living near forested regions are at 
increased risk of displacement, smoke-exposure, injury, and property loss, especially if more populated 
areas are prioritized for ﬁre management response.33  
• 
Legal Status: Undocumented families are not eligible for FEMA assistance and even those who are 
eligible may fear applying. Immigrants may also have concerns about accessing evacuation shelters 
and other relief services due to inadequate cultural and linguistic competency of service providers, and 
undocumented immigrants may fear legal repercussions of seeking services.34 
• 
Emergency Responders: Fireﬁghters, health care personnel and emergency responders are at increased 
risk for injury, death, and respiratory impacts of wildﬁres, as well as mental health affects due to trauma. 
Wildﬁre ﬁre ﬁghters are exposed to safety hazards, including burns, electrocution, ash, slips, trips and 
falls, falling trees, rocks, and vehicle accidents.35,36    
• 
Outdoor Workers: Other outdoor workers (farmworkers, utility workers) are at risk for respiratory effects 
of smoke and pollution.37 
• 
Underlying Health Conditions and Status: Individuals with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory disease 
are at risk of disease exacerbations due to wildﬁre smoke. The emergency conditions created by wildﬁres 
disrupt individuals’ ability to adequately manage their health conditions. 
 
People with disabilities (mobility, sensory, cognitive) may be at greater risk of injury or death 
during evacuations from wildﬁres.
What Local Health Departments Can Do 
See Sections 6—Programs and 7—Functions
Assessment and Surveillance
Assess which neighborhoods and what critical infrastructure are vulnerable to wildﬁres. Wildﬁres can cause 
health problems in communities well downwind of a ﬁre and air quality can remain poor for weeks.38 
The EPA Community Health Vulnerability Index for wildﬁres includes: asthma prevalence in children and adults, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, percent of population 65 years of age and 
older, and indicators of socioeconomic status.39 Researchers recently mapped social vulnerability and biophysical 
41
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
vulnerability to identify communities at risk in the coterminous U.S., areas with high wildﬁre potential had, on 
average, lower social vulnerability to wildﬁres. 
• 
Collaborate with local ﬁre departments and forest services to identify areas vulnerable to wildﬁre. 
• 
Work with local air quality control agencies to ensure that plans are in place for adequate monitoring 
of wildﬁre smoke, both at ﬁxed stations and through low cost, portable monitors for rapid and localized 
monitoring as ﬁres and winds shift.
• 
The data from these indices can be used alongside modeled air quality forecast data generated to develop 
maps of communities with vulnerable populations. 
• 
Partner with local health care partners and facilities to develop systems for syndromic surveillance of 
smoke-related illness, and implement at the onset of a wildﬁre in your region or if smoke from afar is 
creating poor air quality (See Section 7.1—Surveillance). 
• 
After a wildﬁre, survey households using the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency 
Response (CASPER) methodolog40 (See Section 7.1—Surveillance).
Intersectoral Collaboration
Collaborate with community-based organizations to inform vulnerable communities about climate impact 
projections for wildﬁre, and engage community residents in preparedness efforts. In addition, work with:
• 
Zoning departments to support land use policies that reduce development at the urban-wild land 
interface.41  
• 
Building and code enforcement for strengthening  building codes to ensure ﬂame resistance for buildings 
in wildﬁre-prone areas.42   
• 
Local forest service to support smart forestry management, e.g. controlled burns and thinning to manage 
overcrowded forests, which are more susceptible to wildﬁres.43  
• 
Fire and air quality agencies to deploy air monitors that send information from the ground to satellites, 
which transmit real time data to web tools so people can remain informed about smoke levels and air 
quality during a wildﬁre.44 
• 
Social services and health providers to provide HEPA ﬁlters to individuals at high risk for smoke-related 
illness, as smoke can penetrate homes during wildﬁres.45 
• 
Local tribes to ensure Native communities know where shelters are located and how to access services 
following a wildﬁre.
Prepare for Wildﬁre Emergencies
Preparation for wildﬁre emergencies requires attention to what should happen before, during and after a  
wildﬁre event: 
• 
Work with emergency management agencies to engage residents in neighborhood trainings including 
instructions on how to respond if a ﬁre encroaches their property.
• 
Prepare evacuation and displacement plans. Include plans for shelters that are equipped to provide clean 
air, especially for vulnerable populations. 
42
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
 
Establish and exercise plans to ensure that all community members receive information about 
evacuation orders and the location of shelters 
• 
Plan for provision of ﬁtted respirators and masks (P100 or N95)—and how to use them—for those in 
smoke-laden areas.
• 
When deciding on potential closures, consider pollutant levels inside schools and businesses and how 
they are likely to compare to those in homes—in some cases, schools may be safer for children.46  
• 
Consider strategies to provide home air ﬁltration (e.g. HEPA ﬁlters) for high risk individuals.47 
• 
Coordinate with pharmacies to allow prescription reﬁlls for critical medications without renewed contact 
with physicians during emergencies.48 
Be ready to provide information and support after a wildﬁre: 
• 
Connect clients and communities with evacuation and relief centers and ﬁnancial resources to help 
cope after wildﬁres. Vulnerable communities and undocumented individuals and others may be hesitant 
to access services. For an example of assistance for undocumented families after a wildﬁre, see the 
Undocufund site.49  
• 
Work with social services and mental health agencies to assure access to mental health services, 
including for children.
• 
Provide guidelines for safely inspecting and reentering properties50, and make this information readily 
available in emergency shelters, online, through media, in multiple languages, etc. Include information 
on health hazards associated with ﬁre retardants and toxic ash, and about the potential for food 
contamination.51 
Community Engagement and Education 
Find opportunities to integrate mentions of climate change in materials and media messages for the public 
whenever relevant, to increase public awareness that climate change is a health issue. Opportunities include 
public health alerts, health advisory announcements, and educational materials and campaigns related to 
wildﬁres. 
Wildﬁres
Original: Droughts and dry conditions throughout various times of the year increase the risk 
for wildﬁres. Careless use of ﬁre in highly wooded areas can also dramatically increase the 
chance of a wildﬁre, which can then quickly spread across trees and dry brush and threaten 
homes and businesses that are in vicinity.52
Modiﬁed: Droughts and dry conditions throughout various times of the year increase the 
risk for wildﬁres. Wildﬁres are increasing in intensity in our area due to climate change. 
Careless use of ﬁre in highly wooded areas can also dramatically increase the chance of a 
wildﬁre, which can then quickly spread across trees and dry brush and threaten homes and 
businesses that are in vicinity.
43
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Provide guidelines, in multiple languages and via various media, on how to reduce smoke exposure 
including the following example recommendations:53  
 
Close up homes and buildings by shutting windows and doors 
 
Set air conditioners to “re-circulate” settings to prevent smoky outside air from being drawn into 
the building
 
Use air cleaners and HEPA ﬁlters
 
Avoid vacuuming or other activities that can disperse dust
 
Reduce physical activity and drink plenty of ﬂuids 
 
Check the AirNow website (www.airnow.gov) for updated air quality information throughout the 
day as smoke patterns change due to wind and other conditions
 
Wear appropriate respirators and masks (P100 or N95) properly when outside or in smoke-laden 
areas and contact local emergency relief services for ﬁtted respirators if needed. 
• 
For clients and community groups in areas at greater risk of wildﬁre (e.g. in the WUI)
 
Educate clients about maintaining a “defensible” space clear of brush and trees.
 
Advise clients to create a personal and family emergency plan in case of evacuation from wildﬁre.
 
Create informational materials for parents and guardians of young children on the additional 
risks children face during and after a wildﬁre with information to protect them against smoke 
inhalation, chemical exposures, and other hazards.54  
 
Provide air quality notiﬁcations after a wildﬁre and urge communities to limit outdoor exposure 
in times of heavy smoke pollution.
Educate local clinicians on the health impacts of wildﬁres and how they can best protect patient and community 
health during wildﬁres. For more information see A Physician’s Guide on Climate Change, Health and Equity.

4.4 Air Quality
“The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly 
for heart disease and strokes… evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we 
all breathe.”
Dr. Maria Neira, Director, WHO Department for Public Health, 
Environmental and Social Determinants of Health1
Climate Change Worsens Air Quality
• 
Climate change makes it difﬁcult to attain national air quality standards for ground-level ozone, a major 
component of smog, because climate change is causing higher temperatures, which increase ozone 
formation, and increasing the frequency of stagnation events that create the worst ozone episodes.   
Increased ozone levels due to climate change could result in thousands of additional illnesses and 
deaths per year in coming decades.2
• 
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of wildﬁres, which can spread pollution and 
particulate matter over large distances, increasing the risk of premature deaths and respiratory and 
cardiovascular disease risks (See Section 4.3—Wildﬁres).3 
• 
As droughts increase in frequency and severity due to climate change, increased dust levels from dried 
soil worsens air quality.
• 
Climate change also impacts indoor air quality, as intensiﬁed storms and ﬂooding lead to excess moisture 
and mold production. 
• 
Air conditioner use increases with higher temperatures and more extreme heat days, causing increases in 
air pollution from fossil fuel based electricity production.
Air Pollution and Health 
There are 133.9 million people in the U.S. exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution, and 41% of people in the 
U.S. live in counties with unhealthy levels of ozone or particulate matter.4  
• 
Poor air quality exacerbates existing respiratory illness including asthma.5 
•
Increased ozone levels due to climate change could result in thousands of additional illnesses and deaths 
per year in coming decades.6
• 
Air pollution exposure is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, and may 
be related to both low birth weight and preterm birth.7,8    
• 
Poor air quality limits physical activity, which is important for cardiovascular and bone health, obesity 
prevention, and mental health.
• 
Mold exposure from ﬂooding and excess indoor moisture is associated with upper respiratory tract 
symptoms, cough, and wheeze, and can exacerbate asthma.9

Air Quality and Health Equity
• 
Poverty: Low-income households and communities of color are more likely to have neighborhood 
characteristics that increase exposure to climate change-related air pollution, such as proximity to 
roadways and polluting industries, lack of green space, and urban heat islands.
 
Those living in areas with a median household income of $20,000 or less experience rates of 
emergency room visits and hospitalizations for asthma that are four times higher than those in 
areas with a median income greater than $100,000.10 
 
Low-income households, people of color, and non-English speaking and foreign-born persons are 
more likely to live near busy roadways, and therefore face worse air quality.
 
Lack of adequate coverage and health care can result in poorly managed disease for those with 
respiratory or cardiovascular illness. 
• 
Race and Ethnicity: In the U.S., 11.2% of African Americans are currently diagnosed with asthma, 
(compared to 7.7% of Whites) and have an ED visit rate for asthma three times higher than Whites.11 
Nearly 1 in 2 Latinos live in counties frequently violating clean air and ozone standards, exacerbating air 
quality issues, and Latino children are twice as likely to die from asthma as non-Latino Whites.12,13   
• 
Age: Children are particularly sensitive as their respiratory systems are developing and air pollution can 
cause permanent damage. 
• 
Chronic Illness: Individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions, such as asthma, other respiratory 
disease, and cardiovascular disease, are at greater risk of disease exacerbation due to air pollution.
• 
Health Insurance: Lack of adequate coverage and health care can result in poorly managed disease for 
those with respiratory or cardiovascular illness. 
• 
Outdoor Work: Outdoor workers—particularly those engaged in strenuous physical activity—may face 
higher risks due to air pollution.14,15   
What Local Health Departments Can Do 
See Sections 6—Programs and 7—Functions 
Assessment and Surveillance
Identify and collect data to map air quality and identify key sources of air pollution. Collaborate with community 
based organizations and “community scientists” to use portable air quality monitors to learn about air quality 
in the community and enhance air quality monitoring. See the EPA Air Sensor Toolbox (See Section 7.1—
Surveillance).16   
Intersectoral Collaboration 
Work with local and regional air quality agencies: 
• 
Support strong air quality plans that tackle both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, for example 
through providing health data and communications support.17  
47
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Develop an emergency and early warning system for communities at highest risk for increasing episodes 
of poor air quality with climate change:
 
Collaborate with environmental justice and other community groups to plan the warning system. 
 
Prepare text and social media alerts in multiple languages to warn vulnerable individuals that 
air pollution levels are high so they can reduce their exposure and ensure they have needed 
medication.18 
• 
Work with the air district and local community-based organizations to deploy inexpensive real-time air 
monitors that will provide online data on regional air pollution levels and more detailed information 
about air pollution “hot spots.”
• 
Support and encourage city and county efforts to increase energy efﬁciency and renewable energy. 
Advocate for programs to allow lower-income homeowners and renters to beneﬁt from rooftop solar and 
energy efﬁciency programs.
• 
Work with local and regional transportation and planning agencies to reduce transportation-related 
pollution, including from goods movement (See Section 5.1—Transportation).
 
Promotion of energy efﬁciency in both new and existing buildings.
 
Promotion of the switch from natural gas to electricity for space and water heating in buildings.
 
Expansion of urban heat island reduction and air quality improvement strategies such as tree 
planting and other urban greening, cool roofs, and cool pavements. 
• 
Collaborate with parks, public works, and community-based organizations to increase the number 
and diversity of less allergenic trees planted in your jurisdiction and improve other urban heat island 
reduction strategies, to reduce local air pollution and heat-related ozone increases (See Section 5.4—
Urban Greening).
• 
Work with local schools and school districts to reduce trafﬁc-related air pollution exposure near schools:19 
 
Adopt anti-idling policies for school buses, passenger vehicles and delivery trucks.
 
Site new schools away from trafﬁc and in locations that enhance opportunities for biking, 
walking, and taking public transit to school
 
Plant trees to reduce air pollution and provide shaded places for students to be active and socialize, 
and consider use of trees and vegetation as barriers between schools and busy roadways.
 
Upgrade ﬁltration systems used in classrooms.
 
Locate air intakes away from pollution sources
• 
Implement policies in your department (and encourage your jurisdiction to do the same across agencies) 
that reduce vehicle-miles-travelled for ﬁeld staff and reduce automobile commuting for all staff (See 
Section 5.1—Transportation).
48
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Prepare for the Air Quality Impacts of Climate Change
• 
Develop an emergency and early warning system for communities at highest risk for increasing episodes 
of poor air quality with climate change:
 
Collaborate with environmental justice and other community groups to plan the warning system. 
 
Prepare text and social media alerts in multiple languages to warn vulnerable individuals that 
air pollution levels are high so they can reduce their exposure and ensure they have needed 
medication.20 
 
Messages should include clear instructions to reduce exposure (i.e. stay indoors and limit  
physical activity).
 
Collaborate with local media sources to broadcast information on where the public can go for  
air quality-related information; broadcast air quality conditions, information to reduce impacts 
and related illness exacerbation, and encouragement to check on vulnerable neighbors and  
family members.
• 
Prepare plans for clean air shelters and disseminate information about clean air shelters to individuals 
who are at high risk of serious health complications from extended periods of poor air quality.
Community Engagement and Education
Look for opportunities to integrate mentions of climate change in materials and media messages for the public 
whenever relevant, to increase public awareness that climate change is a health issue. Opportunities include 
public health alerts, health advisory announcements, and educational materials and campaigns related to air 
quality. For example:
Air Quality
Original: Air pollution comes from a variety sources, including industrial sources, 
transportation, farming practices and even natural sources. Air quality on any given day is 
also impacted by a complex set of factors involving the weather and how pollutants interact 
with each other in the atmosphere.21
Modiﬁed: Air pollution comes from a variety sources, including industrial sources, 
transportation, farming practices and even natural sources. Air quality on any given day is 
also impacted by a complex set of factors involving the weather and how pollutants interact 
with each other in the atmosphere, and by climate change that is causing more pollen and 
more very hot days that increase air pollution. 
49
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Conduct public awareness campaigns in multiple languages and via various media and educate clients on 
the rising risks of poor air quality due to climate change. 
• 
Encourage walking and biking on less busy roadways—even a block away from busiest roadways has  
less pollution.22 
• 
Advise clients with asthma or other respiratory illness to check the Air Quality Index every day for unsafe 
ozone and particulate levels. Talk to clients about adjusting their activities and recreation when air 
quality is bad. For clients who smoke, encourage them to quit and provide resource support.
• 
Educate local clinicians on the health impacts of climate change and air quality and how they can best 
protect patient and community health during bad air days. For more information see A Physician’s Guide 
on Climate Change, Health and Equity. Encourage clinicians to have posters in their facilities regarding 
climate change and asthma in children and adults.

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
Multnomah County Health Department (MCHD) in Oregon has a long-term focus on equity and a history of 
working with community-based organizations on place-based health initiatives, and with the regional land  
use and transportation planning organization and other agencies on climate adaptation. Many of MCHDs 
community partners work in environmental justice communities that are disproportionately vulnerable to climate 
health impacts. 
In early 2016, MCHD built on an existing partnership with the Coalition of Communities of Color (CCC) to 
launch the Healthy Environments Data Indicator Project (HEDIP), in collaboration with Portland State University 
Planning Department. The project grew out of a request to improve community capacity to work with MCHD in 
designing health and environmental data collection, analysis, and tools of greater use to the community. 
HEDIP created a climate and health tool that uses an interactive story board to display a series of brief narratives 
that accompany county maps of 20 indicators in four vulnerability domains: 1) demographics, 2) socioeconomic 
status, 3) existing health burden, and 4) air pollution from point sources. The indicators were also combined into 
a single score that was used to rank and map climate and health vulnerability for each of the 171 Multnomah 
County census tracts. CCC provided input into indicator selection and display. In a facilitated training with 
four CCC climate and environmental justice member organizations, MCDH reviewed the HEDIP ﬁndings and 
discussed the use of data to support policy and systems change.  
Interagency Collaboration: 
Multnomah County 
Health Department
• Establish partnerships with local CBOs 
that represent communities that bear 
a disproportionate burden of climate 
and/or environmental impacts. (See 
Section 7.2—Engagement) 
• Seek input from community partners 
on indicators, and share data and 
information to build CBO capacity to 
understand and use data to engage in 
local planning and policy advocacy.
• Translate climate and health 
vulnerability assessments into 
accessible, understandable formats.
• Use data to inform local and 
state policymakers about health 
vulnerabilities relevant to policy.
Key Action Steps:
51
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
CCC developed and piloted two community-led climate and health workshops that covered climate, health, and 
justice concepts, and used the HEDIP tool to educate policy makers about the importance of addressing the needs 
of disadvantaged communities in state climate policy. These conversations informed the discussion of a proposed 
“Healthy Climate Bill” (SB1574) that would create a carbon trading market linked with GHGE reduction goals, 
and direct a portion of carbon auction revenues to projects that beneﬁt disadvantaged communities. HEDIP 
served to illustrate a potential mechanism to identify disadvantaged communities.  
During this time, MCDH, CCC, and other stakeholders identiﬁed air pollution as a key priority. Further analysis 
by MCDH determined that transportation-related pollution and residential wood smoke burning contributed 
more pollution than point sources in Multnomah County. These analyses—with other HEDIP data—informed 
development of neighborhood climate and health proﬁles and policy briefs, and were used by MCDH to provide 
input into Multnomah County’s analyses of 30 state legislative bills. 
Future Work and Lessons Learned
MCHD continues to translate data into action, using the Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modeling Tool 
(ITHIM) to inform the Regional Transportation Plan (See Section 7.1—Surveillance). MCHD is now an active 
participant in an interdepartmental workgroup convened by the County Ofﬁce of Sustainability to update and 
implement the county’s climate action plan, and is providing technical assistance on the use of HEDIP climate 
vulnerability maps. For example, Transportation and Emergency Management are using the maps to inform 
planning efforts.

4.5 Allergens
Climate change affects the start, duration, and intensity of global pollen seasons, and causes 
increases in other air pollutants and respiratory illnesses that exacerbate asthma1
Climate Change Increases Allergen Exposures
• 
Increasing temperatures lead to earlier and longer pollen and allergy seasons, due to more frost-free days 
and earlier and longer ﬂowering seasons. Since 1995, the season for ragweed pollen—one of the most 
common outdoor allergens—has lengthened by over 20 days in some parts of the U.S. (See Figure 4.5.1)2  
Figure 4.5.1:  Change in Ragweed Pollen Season, 1995–20153 
• 
Higher carbon dioxide levels and more winter precipitation cause greater plant growth, resulting in 
increased pollen production and potency.4 This will increase the allergenicity of trees commonly found 
across the U.S. 
 
Annual birch pollen production and peak values are expected to be 1.3–2.3 times higher from 
2020–2100.5 
53
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Exposure to allergy-inducing molds— 
the allergencity of which can also 
increase with higher CO2 levels—may 
increase as more frequent and severe 
extreme storms lead to more ﬂooding.6 
• 
Higher temperatures increase 
production of ozone, which sensitizes 
the respiratory tract to allergens.7 
• 
Carbon dioxide enhances production 
of the chemical (urushiol) in poison 
ivy and poison oak that causes 
contact dermatitis; carbon dioxide also 
increases the spread in growth of these 
allergenic plants.
Health Impacts of Allergens
Hay fever, asthma, and eczema are the 
three major allergic diseases associated with 
exposure to pollens from trees, weeds, grasses, 
molds, and other indoor allergens.8 Nearly 40% 
of urban populations and close to 25% of rural 
populations in the U.S. are sensitive to outdoor 
allergens.9 The prevalence of hay fever in the 
U.S. rose from 10% in 1970 to 30% in 2000.10 
Allergies are a signiﬁcant contributor to work 
and school absence and the 6th most costly 
chronic disease in the U.S., with healthcare 
expenditures of about $21 billion annually.11  
Allergens and Health Equity
• 
Housing: Poor housing construction 
and maintenance can increase exposure 
to pollen or mold.12  
• 
Poverty: People living in poverty 
may lack health insurance coverage 
for allergy management. Low-income 
communities and households have 
fewer resources for home rehabilitation 
to prevent mold growth following 
ﬂooding.13  
54
CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
• 
Race and Ethnicity: African Americans tend to have higher rates of allergic sensitization compared  
to Whites.14 
• 
Working Conditions: Outdoor workers face increased exposure to pollen and to allergenic plants. Low-
wage workers without paid sick leave face job and economic loss if required to miss work due to allergies 
or asthma.15 
• 
Asthma or other Chronic Respiratory Illness: Exposure to aeroallergens can trigger asthma symptoms.16 
• 
Air Pollution: Ozone causes airway sensitization, so people living in areas with high ozone levels may be 
at higher risk.17 
What Local Health Departments Can Do 
See Sections 6—Programs and 7—Functions
Assessment and Surveillance 
• 
Collaborate with other agencies and organizations to improve pollen monitoring in your jurisdiction.18 
• 
Prepare an online forum for community scientists in your jurisdiction to report the timing of pollen 
production in their neighborhood. This data can then be cross-referenced with data on tree cover and air 
quality to identify vulnerable areas.19 
Intersectoral Collaboration
Collaborate with public works, parks and recreation, urban forestry, planning, and community based 
organizations—including local botanic gardens, arboretums, and horticultural societies—to establish policies 
for preferential planting of less allergenic trees and plants, and for planting a variety of trees so that people are 
at less risk of an allergic response to a particular pollen.20 Consult with allergy specialists and work with public 
works and local tree-planting groups to ensure that allergenicity is a tree-selection consideration. 
• 
Many cities favor planting of male trees to avoid tree-litter on sidewalks, but it is male trees that  
produce pollen.21  
• 
Consider a pollen control ordinance (as in Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Tucson) to prohibit planting or sale  
of highly allergenic plants.22 
• 
Support policies that reduce air pollution, which exacerbates respiratory illnesses and the impacts of 
allergens. Ozone, the key pollutant associated with climate change, may be the major driver of pollutant/
pollen interactions.23 
Community Engagement and Education
Look for opportunities to integrate mentions of climate change in materials and media messages for the public 
whenever relevant, to increase public awareness that climate change is a health issue. Opportunities include 
public health alerts, health advisory announcements, and educational materials and campaigns related to 
allergens. For example:
55
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Pollen 
Original: Ragweed pollen is dominant in the fall and blooms from Mid-July to September.24
Modiﬁed: Ragweed pollen is dominant in the fall and blooms from Mid-July to September. 
Rising temperatures associated with climate change can lead to longer and more severe 
ragweed seasons.
• 
Educate clients and communities—in multiple languages and via various media—on the rising risks of 
allergens, and how to minimize exposures, reduce allergy symptoms, and manage asthma. 
 
Check pollen levels frequently—individuals can sign up for free alerts at National Allergy 
BureauTM.
 
For clients with asthma, check ozone levels.  
 
For individuals with allergies: The best times to be outdoors are when pollen levels are lower, 
typically on rainy, cloudy, and windless days. Keep windows closed during allergy season to 
prevent pollen from drifting inside; drive with car windows closed. Shower after time outdoors, to 
remove pollen that can collect on your skin, clothes, and hair.
• 
Provide opportunities for community scientists to participate in pollen and asthma monitoring. For 
example, Louisville’s Asthmapolis project tracks asthma attacks using a mobile network of smart 
inhalers; city staff are mapping attacks to see correlations with tree cover, air quality, and heat islands.25 
• 
Use home visits to educate clients about allergens, mold prevention, and climate change, and to assess 
housing conditions. Provide referrals to low-income weatherization services (e.g. better sealing of windows). 
• 
Educate local clinicians about climate change and allergies and how they can best protect patient and 
community health. See A Physician’s Guide on Climate Change, Health and Equity. Encourage local 
clinicians to put up posters in their facilities regarding the impact of climate change on allergies.

4.6 Sea Level Rise
Climate Change Increases the Risk of Sea Level Rise and Related Flooding
• 
Globally, under moderate emissions scenarios, sea levels are expected to rise 0.3–0.6 feet by 2030, 0.5–1.2ft 
by 2050, and 1.0–4.3ft by 2100.1 The rate of sea level rise is now greater than in at least the last 2,800 years.
•
Sea level rise in the U.S. will vary along the country’s coastlines:2 Under all scenarios, the Northeast and 
Gulf of Mexico coastlines are expected to see greater sea level rise than the global averages, while the 
Paciﬁc Northwest and Alaska are expected to see less under low and moderate sea level rise scenarios. 
• 
Rising sea levels in the U.S. will increase the frequency and extent of coastal ﬂooding with hurricanes, 
Nor’easters, and other coastal storms. 
Health Impacts of Sea Level Rise
Health risks associated with rising sea levels include:
• 
Increased risk of waterborne illness, vector born disease, and indoor mold growth3,4 (See Section 4.7—
Storms and Flooding).
• 
Displacement of communities living in coastal areas, increasing their risk of related mental health problems. 
• 
Increased salinity of groundwater basins and well water:
 
Higher salinity in drinking water has been associated with increased blood pressure and kidney 
disease, and higher risk of preeclampsia.5,6,7      
Reduced crop yields in agricultural areas, impacting food security.8
 
Changes in the growth of microorganisms and vectors that use water as breeding grounds, with 
potential impacts on waterborne and vector borne illness.9 
• 
Impacts on hazardous material sites, with risk of community exposure to toxic materials.10  
• 
Inundation of coastal wastewater and water treatment facilities in the event of storms and storm surge.11  
• 
Ground, surface and drinking water contamination from inundation of septic systems, especially in  
rural areas.12 
• 
Impacts on coastal tourism through damage to beachfront property and beaches, with signiﬁcant 
economic and job losses.13 
Sea Level Rise and Health Equity
• 
Geography: Populations that reside in coastal areas are most impacted by sea level rise.
•
Poverty: Low-income households are less likely to have disaster insurance, less able to recover from 
ﬂooding and property loss associated with sea level rise, and have fewer resources to relocate.14
 
Residents of areas with failing public waste and water infrastructure, lack of protective barriers 
(e.g. seawalls), and poor public transit are more vulnerable to ﬂooding and may face evacuation 
challenges. 
57
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
 
Low-income communities and households lack funds for adaptation responses, such as elevating 
roads or costly remodels to elevate homes, which could lessen the risk of displacement and its 
associated health impacts.15   
 
Communities with poor housing quality and building ventilation are at increased risk of indoor 
air pollution from excess moisture and vector borne disease due to lack of window screens. 
 
Low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by food and water price increases due 
to sea level rise impacts on drinking water and crop yield. 
• 
Gentriﬁcation and displacement: As ﬂooding from sea level rise becomes more common, wealthier 
homeowners are moving to higher ground, displacing lower income communities that have historically 
been redlined from beachfront neighborhoods.16 
• 
Tribal Communities: Indigenous communities that practice subsistence farming and ﬁshing are 
particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise—including saline intrusion—on crops and 
freshwater ecosystems, and of ﬁsheries collapse.17 Coastal inundation also threatens important indigenous 
cultural and archaeological resources.18 
 
98% of Isle de Jean Charles—the home of a Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw community off the coast 
of Louisiana—has been lost to sea level rise. Tribal leaders are working with local organizations 
to create community-based resettlement strategies that emphasize community cohesion and 
traditions, youth engagement, and sharing experience with other coastal communities facing 
similar challenges.19  
• 
Chronic Illness: Individuals with illnesses such as asthma or other respiratory conditions are more 
vulnerable to indoor air pollution and mold illness from excess moisture or ﬂooding.20  
• 
Individuals with Disabilities: Cognitive, hearing, physical, and mobility impairments may impede safe 
evacuation during ﬂooding events.21   
What Local Health Departments Can Do

Assessment and Surveillance
Collaborate with other agencies to understand projections for sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, and ﬂooding 
due to groundwater inundation and storm surges. Work with local emergency management, public works, water 
agencies and coastal conservation agencies and organizations to develop maps of ﬂood-prone coastal areas and

Community Engagement and Education
Look for opportunities to integrate climate change in materials and media messages for the public to increase 
public awareness that climate change is a health issue. Opportunities include public health alerts and advisories 
and educational materials related to sea level rise. For example:

Original: Some coastal wells in Washington are now unusable because of seawater intrusion. 
This is particularly true in coastal areas where high population growth has placed increased 
demands on groundwater supplies.27
Modiﬁed: Some coastal wells in Washington are now unusable because of seawater 
intrusion, which is associated with sea level rise due to climate change. This is particularly 
true in coastal areas where high population growth has placed increased demands on

• 
Develop and implement a plan for community engagement and participation in sea level rise vulnerability 
assessments and planning.28 Folly Beach, South Carolina included community input from vulnerable 
neighborhoods in preparing the city’s Sea Level Rise Adaptation Report.2 
• 
Conduct public awareness campaigns—in multiple languages and via various media—and educate clients 
and communities on risks related to rising sea levels, and how to stay safe and healthy during and after 
extreme ﬂooding events.
• 
Engage residents in community science initiatives such as the Urban Tides Community Science Initiative. 
• 
Develop resources to explain how to properly address in-home dampness and ﬂooding, tenant and 
landlord responsibilities, and how to select a professional contractor. See the Extreme Storms and 
Flooding section for more details.30  
• 
Advise community members to create a personal and family emergency plan in case of evacuation from 
ﬂooding and connect them with resources to cope with displacement.

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
The San Francisco Department of Public Health 
(SFDPH) launched its Climate & Health Program in 
2010 with funding from the CDC’s Climate Ready 
States and Cities Initiative. The ﬁrst step in the BRACE 
framework is to anticipate climate impacts and 
assess vulnerability. SFDPH completed assessments 
for extreme heat events (2013) and ﬂooding and 
extreme storms (2016), a climate and health proﬁle 
exploring the major health impacts of climate change, 
preparedness plans for extreme heat and storm/
ﬂooding emergencies, and a health co-beneﬁts 
analysis of the county’s climate action plan. 
To assess public health preparedness, Climate 
and Health program (CHP) staff surveyed SFDPH 
leadership to better understand perceptions of climate 
impacts and capacity to implement adaptations, 
reviewed SFDPH strategic planning documents to 
identify opportunities for departmental action, and 
assessed climate vulnerability of SFDPH facilities. 
From Assessment to Action
In 2017, CHP shifted from assessment to action with 
the release of its Climate and Health Adaptation 
Framework. The Framework provides “a starting 
point to engage San Francisco’s diverse City and community stakeholders in designing solutions that reduce 
health disparities and climate health impacts… a tool to begin conversations about how best to adapt to the 
health impacts of climate change.” It includes the prior vulnerability assessments, indicators of climate risk, an 
overview of SFDPHs capacity to address climate and health, and proposed strategies and activities to reduce risk 
and promote health equity in the era of climate change.
The Framework outlines over 70 interventions, including working with other city departments to develop an 
in-building leak audit program for low-income homes, and evaluating the effectiveness of public information 
services in extreme weather events. Equity is a guiding principle in the work of SFDPH, and the Framework 
explicitly addresses the disproportionate burden of climate and health impacts on low-income communities and 
communities of color.

HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Future Work and Lessons Learned 
SFDPH is developing a Climate and Health Outreach Plan to increase engagement with residents and community 
based organizations to prioritize adaptation strategies that respond to the concerns of vulnerable communities. 
Climate and health champions have been identiﬁed across SFDPH programs, and SFDPH is bringing their 
expertise into efforts to improve collaboration with twelve City departments. One proposal is the development of 
a uniﬁed climate and health message for use across multiple City climate initiatives.
Former climate and health program director, Cyndy Comerford shared, “the most successful partnerships have 
been with organizations and city departments that share our view that climate change is a systems issue, 
connected to transportation, food, energy, health care systems, and beyond.”

CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTH, AND EQUITY: A GUIDE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
4.7 Storms and Flooding
Climate Change Increases the Risk of Extreme Storms and Flooding 
Extreme precipitation events occur when the air is almost completely saturated, which can occur more quickly 
at higher temperatures, so extreme evens are likely to increase in intensity by about 6% to 7% for each degree 
Celsius of temperature increase.1 
•
As the U.S. has many geographic regions, future changes in seasonal average precipitation will be 
variable depending on season and geography. Overall, high-latitude regions are projected to become 
wetter, subtropical areas drier, but there is signiﬁcant uncertainty regarding the U.S. middle latitudes.2
• 
The number of extreme precipitation events is expected to increase by two to three times historical 
averages in every U.S. region by 2100, with the highest increases expected in the Northeast.3 
• 
Due to climate change, global precipitation patterns are likely to become more variable into the future, 
with extremes becoming more extreme, which can lead to additional vulnerability. 4
Health Impacts of Extreme Precipitation
• 
Extreme storms directly cause injury and death due to trauma and drowning. 
 
Although the ofﬁcial count due to Hurricane Maria is 64 fatalities in Puerto Rico, some analysts 
place the actual number at over 4,000.5 
• 
Extreme storms and ﬂooding can disrupt medical care, particularly for those with chronic illness. Three 
days after Hurricane Maria, only 3 hospitals on Puerto Rico were functioning, and 40% were still running 
on generator power two months after the storm.6 Two major hospitals were evacuated during Super 
Storm Sandy, and several were not yet fully operational a year after the storm. 
 
A third of deaths after Hurricane Maria were attributed to delayed or interrupted health care,  
and many residents reported inability to access medications and lack of electricity for respiratory 
equipment.7 
•
Extreme storms can disrupt critical infrastructure, including electricity, sanitation, water treatment, food 
refrigeration, communications systems, and transportation.8 Months after Hurricane Maria, close to 50% 
of homes on Puerto Rico were still without power, nearly 50% of the island’s sewage treatment plants did 
not have electricity to operate, and over 300,000 Puerto Ricans still lacked access to clean water.9,10,11,12
• 
Mold exposure and related mold illness post-ﬂooding may increase due to excess indoor moisture and is 
associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze, and can exacerbate asthma.13
• 
Water-borne illness risks increase due to exposure to sewage or water treatment systems overﬂow, or skin 
wounds and fungal infections from exposure to ﬂood waters.14 
• 
Heavy rainfall is frequently followed by a proliferation of mosquitos, increasing the risk of vector-borne 
illnesses particularly in warmer climates.15 
• 
Flooding from storms can contaminate ground and surface water resources with runoff from hazardous 
and superfund sites.16  
63
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Use of diesel generators during power 
outages can impact air quality. Improper use 
of generators in enclosed spaces caused 15 
deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning 
after Hurricane Sandy.17 
• 
Extreme precipitation can lead to erosion 
and dangerous mudslides, increasing risk of 
injury and death, as seen in Montecito, CA 
when heavy precipitation caused destructive 
mudslides and over 20 fatalities in January 
2018, following the largest wildﬁre in 
California history that charred much of the 
area’s soil in December 2017.18 
• 
Extreme precipitation and ﬂooding cause 
displacement—which poses risks associated 
with injury, exposure to contaminated 
ﬂoodwaters, and loss of medications—and 
property loss.19 An estimated 1.5 million ﬂed 
their homes after Hurricane Katrina, and 
some estimate that hundreds of thousands 
were never able to return.20 Damage to the 
Oroville Dam following severe rains caused 
the evacuation of over 100,000 people for 
two days.21  
Extreme Precipitation and  
Health Equity
• 
Failing and Aging Public Infrastructure: 
Lack of investment in secure transportation 
or protective barriers leaves residents 
vulnerable to ﬂooding and poses barriers 
for evacuation. Inadequate or failing water 
treatment and sewage systems—especially 
combined sewer overﬂow systems— 
increase the risk of contamination after 
ﬂoods and storms. 
• 
Poverty: Low-income communities are 
disproportionately underinsured for extreme 
weather events and often lack access to 
emergency credit to recuperate from property 
loss. As climate change increases the 
frequency and severity of extreme weather 
Extreme Storms 
and Mental Health: 
Hurricane Katrina
Exposure to extreme weather events, such as 
ﬂoods, hurricanes and wildﬁres, is associated 
with a range of mental health impacts, 
including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
depression, anxiety and suicide, increased 
rates of substance abuse, and interpersonal 
violence.22 Mental health impacts persisted 
long after Hurricane Katrina and its immediate 
aftermath were over. 
• 
In some impacted areas, prevalence of PTSD 
rose from 15% a few months after the 
hurricane to 21% a year later. During the 
same timeframe, the proportion of people 
with suicidal thoughts more than doubled: 
from 2.8% to 6.4%.23 
• 
Veterans with preexisting mental illness 
were 6.8 times more likely to develop 
additional mental illness after the disaster, 
as compared to those without a preexisting 
mental condition.24  
• 
Hope abounds: One study found that 
two-thirds of those who experienced 
increased rates of PTSD and psychosis one 
year after the storm no longer displayed 
symptoms of psychological distress three 
years afterwards, while some others even 
reported “post-traumatic growth,” or the 
feeling that surviving the hurricane made 
them stronger. These ﬁndings suggest 
the importance of long-term support 
for survivors of climate change-related 
disasters.25

events, insurance prices will rise and continue to move further out of reach for low-income individuals 
and communities.26 Four out of 5 homes damaged by Hurricane Harvey lacked ﬂood insurance.27 
• 
Homelessness: Homeless people often occupy areas near creeks or rivers, making them more vulnerable 
to storms and ﬂoods.28 
• 
Substandard Housing: Poor housing quality and ventilation increase the risk of indoor air pollution and 
most from excess moisture.  
• 
Legal Status: Undocumented families are not eligible for FEMA assistance and even those who are 
eligible may fear applying. Immigrants may also have concerns about accessing evacuation shelters 
and other relief services due to inadequate cultural and linguistic competency of service providers, and 
undocumented immigrants may fear legal repercussions of seeking services.29 
• 
Chronic illness: Extreme storms can interrupt treatment for chronic illnesses due to displacement, power 
outages, stressed health systems, and high-demand for medical supplies.30,31    
• 
Individuals with Disabilities: People with disabilities have high rates of illness, injuries, or death during 
extreme events, as cognitive, hearing, physical, and mobility impairments may impede safe evacuation. 
 
Emergency information and instructions are not always accessible for those with disabilities that 
affect communication, and individuals with disabilities can have challenges communicating their 
needs in an emergency or evacuation situation.32,33   
 
Power outages can impair electrically powered medical equipment and elevators, preventing some 
from evacuating or leaving them without necessary treatments.34 
“When patients with cardiac health issues face evacuation due to ﬂooding, ﬁre or other natural 
disasters, a spike in stress and anxiety levels may be only the beginning. For sudden, jarring, life-
changing events—like that of Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana this past week—can markedly 
disrupt months or years of steady treatment and control of heart disease and other conditions.”
American Heart Association35 
• 
Race and Ethnicity: African Americans households faced slower recovery from Hurricane Katrina 
compared to comparable white households, and recent studies have revealed higher rates of mental 
illness among Hurricane Katrina survivors who were African American, low-income, and between the 
ages of 18 and 34, especially single mothers.36,37  
• 
Age: Almost half of the deaths resulting from Hurricane Katrina were people over the age of 75, and over 
10% of total deaths occurred in nursing homes.38 
• 
Women and Children: Extreme storms, ﬂooding, and related stress can negatively impact pregnancies 
and disrupt related care, while children are susceptible to severe mental health impacts39 Globally, 
women are injured and die more often from extreme events.40

San Francisco Department of Public Health44
The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) conducted a ﬂood health vulnerability 
assessment in order to focus resources on and design interventions for vulnerable populations. 
SFDPH included indicators on socioeconomic and demographic, exposure to ﬂooding, pre-existing 
health conditions, and housing quality (see the table below). To obtain data, the department 
used results from the American Community Survey and from other local agencies, such as the 
San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, California Ofﬁce of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development, the 2015 San Francisco Homeless Count, the San Francisco Police Department, and 
the San Francisco Fire Department.

SFDPH was able to overlay available 
data creating vulnerability indexes 
for each indicator set and a combined 
ﬂood health vulnerability score by 
block group and neighborhood. The 
resulting maps deﬁned areas that are 
most likely to experience ﬂooding 
and areas that are most likely to 
experience the health impacts of this 
ﬂooding.
What Local Health Departments Can Do 
See Sections 6—Programs and 7—Functions
Assessment and Surveillance
• 
Collaborate with local emergency management, public works, and other agencies to collect and share 
data to conduct a ﬂood vulnerability assessment:
 
identify ﬂood-prone areas and areas in need of updated infrastructure to reduce ﬂood risk.
 
identify critical infrastructure vulnerable to ﬂoods and storm surges.
 
identify neighborhoods with social vulnerability to ﬂoods. Social vulnerability indicators used 
in one index created speciﬁcally for hurricanes included poverty, gender, race and ethnicity, age, 
and disabilities.41 
• 
FEMA offers ﬂood maps searchable by speciﬁc addresses, though ﬂooding from Hurricane Harvey 
demonstrates that many of these maps are out of date.42,43

Collaborate with Parks, Public Works, 
Emergency Management, and community 
groups to develop and implement a green 
infrastructure plan to reduce storm water 
runoff and ﬂooding risks and to protect 
waterways and sewage lines from debris 
and pollutants (See Section 7.5—Greening). 
• 
Collaborate with community-based organizations to inform vulnerable communities about climate 
impact projections for storm surge, precipitation and ﬂooding, and engage community residents in ﬂood 
resilience and preparedness.
• 
Work with local organizations and health care institutions to implement a voluntary registry for those 
with physical, mental, and sensory disabilities to preauthorize emergency response personnel to enter 
their homes during search-and-rescue operations.47 
• 
Collaborate with vector control agencies to assure availability of increased mosquito monitoring following 
extreme precipitation and ﬂood events.
• 
Work with local tribes to ensure Native communities know where shelters are located and how to access 
services following ﬂooding and extreme storms.
Prepare for Extreme Storms and Flooding
• 
Develop a ﬂood warning alert system for areas at risk:
 
Prepare boil water orders and other alerts in multiple languages so they are ready to issue to 
various media outlets and through text alerts and/or social media.
 
If landslides or debris ﬂows have occurred previously in your jurisdiction, prepare messaging and 
resources for communities to prepare for a potential future event.48 
 
Evaluate use and effectiveness of public information services during and after extreme weather 
events.49

HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
• 
Prepare plans for shelters with backup power sources and ensure the needs of vulnerable populations 
are taken into consideration; disseminate shelter information to at risk groups including older adults, 
pregnant women, those with chronic illness who require medications, and low income communities.50 
 
Ensure all shelters and emergency centers are accessible to and comfortable for individuals with 
physical and mental disabilities. 
 
Connect individuals with local shelters that provide safe spaces, especially for LGBTQ individuals 
who are at higher risk of harassment and assault. 
 
Prepare information sheets for families in shelters on the potential for health outcomes from 
ﬂooding and mental health impacts from stress and displacement, including how to ﬁnd services.
 
Ensure local wastewater treatment facilities that may be vulnerable to ﬂooding have prepared 
response plans. 
 
Work with social services and mental health agencies to assure access to mental health services.
• 
Collaborate with health care facilities and systems to increase ﬂood resilience and plan for extreme storm 
and ﬂooding events.
 
Develop a plan for how medical care will continue if ﬂooding impacts health care facilities. For 
example, coordinate with pharmacies to allow reﬁll prescriptions for people with chronic illness, 
even if unable to contact the prescribing physician, during emergencies.51 
 
Advocate for integration of design features in new health facilities that foster resiliency to 
ﬂooding, for example:52 
 
Elevation of ﬁrst ﬂoor above projected ﬂood elevation and placement of critical patient 
care functions above ﬁrst ﬂoor 
 
Placement of all critical mechanical/electrical infrastructure on the roof and/or above 
ﬂood elevations
 
Use of green roofs to reduce storm water discharge 
• 
Assure that chronically ill patients, their communities, and their providers have contingency plans during 
and after disasters.53 
• 
Make sure evacuation strategies address the needs of all members of the community, including those 
without access to automobiles, non-English speakers, and people with disabilities.
Community Engagement and Education
Look for opportunities to integrate mentions of climate change in materials and media messages for the public 
whenever relevant, to increase public awareness that climate change is a health issue. Opportunities include 
public health alerts, health advisory announcements, and educational materials and campaigns related to storms 
and ﬂooding. For example:

Modiﬁed: Heavy rain causes ﬂoodwaters to rise and pool on streets and throughout 
neighborhoods. As climate change increases the potential for more intense storms and 
related ﬂooding, we need to be even more prepared. In these situations, be aware of the 
following… 
• 
Conduct public awareness campaigns—in multiple languages and via various media—and educate clients 
and communities on the rising risks of extreme weather due to climate change, health risks, and how to 
stay safe and healthy during and after extreme events.
• 
Advise clients to create a personal and family emergency plan in case of evacuation from an extreme 
storm or ﬂooding. Educate clients about the potential for ﬂooding following wildﬁres and discuss the 
potential need for ﬂood insurance.55 
• 
Develop resources to explain how to properly address in-home dampness and ﬂooding, tenant and 
landlord responsibilities, and how to select a professional contractor.56 Use home visits to provide 
guidelines for reentering homes after ﬂooding:57 
 
Remind individuals to NEVER turn power on or off or use an electric tool or appliance while 
standing in water. 
 
Provide information about the risks of sewage contamination and mold for individuals whose 
homes are ﬂooded,
 
Educate individuals on indoor air quality concerns following ﬂooding. Provide information on 
mold prevention and treatment options, including preventing mold by washing surfaces with 
water and detergent and wearing an N95 mask while treating mold.58 
 
Provide safety guidelines for drying out and cleaning ﬂooded homes
•
Educate local clinicians on the health impacts of extreme storm events and how they can best protect 
patient and community health during storms and ﬂooding. For more information see A Physician’s Guide 
on Climate Change, Health and Equity.

4.8 Nutrition and Food Security
Food security is “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.”1 It 
requires that a stable, nutritious food supply is available and accessible to all communities to nourish 
themselves. 
Climate Change Threatens Food Security2,3   
• 
Crop yields are reduced by extreme heat, drought, and extreme weather events, all of which are increasing 
in frequency and severity due to climate change.4 Warmer temperatures also cause higher ground-level 
ozone concentrations that cause millions of tons of crop losses each year.5 Warmer temperatures are 
leading to fewer “chill hours”, required for production of avocados, nuts, and tree fruits.6
•
Higher temperatures and drought associated with climate change can cause heat stress and illness in 
livestock, reducing milk and egg production.7
• 
Declining ﬁsh yields due to overﬁshing and ocean dead zones are further impacted by ocean acidiﬁcation 
from with rising carbon dioxide levels. 
• 
Warmer temperatures increase the growth of Salmonella, Camphylobacter, Rotavirus, and various Vibrio, 
and harmful algal blooms, increasing the risk of food contamination.8  
• 
Increased atmospheric CO2 reduces the nutritional value of crops such as barley, sorghum, soy, wheat 
and rice by reducing their protein and micronutrientscontent.9  
• 
Extreme weather events can disrupt transportation of food products, disrupting food supply chains and 
increasing loss due to spoilage.10 
• 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global food production will 
decrease by 2% per decade, while global food demand increases by 14% per decade.11 Climate change 
has increased the number of malnourished children by 7–20% globally.12 
Agricultural Systems Drive Climate Change
See Section 5.3—Agriculture 
•
In 2016, agriculture contributed about 9% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions13 (See Figure 
4.8.1).
• 
When fertilizer use, refrigeration, transportation, and land use changes are taken into account, our 
food and agriculture systems account for about a third of all global GHGE.14 The typical American meal 
includes ingredients from at least ﬁve other countries, contributing to transportation GHGE, especially if 
food is shipped by air.15   
• 
Expansion of agricultural lands can lead to deforestation and soil degradation, removing important 
carbon sinks.16

Production in 2010 (kg CO2-eqis kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents)17
Health Impacts of Food Insecurity22 
Food insecurity includes under-consumption 
(of nutrients, fruits, vegetables, and protein in 
developing nations) and overconsumption of low-cost, 
high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. Under-consumption 
negatively impacts development and diminishes 
physical capacity.23 Over-consumption is a major 
contributor to development of chronic diseases such 
as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. 
• 
In 2014, 37.9% of adults and 20.6% of 
adolescents in the U.S. were obese.24 
• 
About 1 in every 4 deaths in the U.S. is 
the result of heart disease (approximately 
610,000 people annually).25 
• 
9.4 percent of the U.S. population (30.3 
million people) has diabetes, and 84.1 million have prediabetes.26 
• 
Overconsumption of red and processed meat is associated with increased risk of heart disease, stroke, 
Type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and premature death.27 
• 
Good nutrition is essential to healthy pregnancy, nursing and newborn outcomes.
Food Waste18
Forty percent of food produced in the United 
States goes uneaten. That’s 62.5 million tons 
of food. Households generate 43% of all food 
waste. Meanwhile, there were 42.2 million 
people, including 13.1 million children, who 
did not have enough food in 2015.19 In landﬁlls, 
these organic materials are broken down 
by bacteria to produce methane, a potent 
greenhouse gas (GHG).20 Diversion of food 
waste from the landﬁll to better uses, including 
safe food donation, addresses two critical 
health issues—food insecurity and climate 
change.21

Food Security and Health Equity
• 
Poverty: Low-income people have less ability to absorb rising food prices and may be forced to choose 
between food and other necessities. Food insecurity is associated with higher risks for diabetes and 
hypertension.28 
• 
Food Deserts: According to 2000 data, 13.5 million people in the U.S. have low access to a supermarket, 
82 % of whom live in urban areas.29 In these areas, the impacts of climate change on food security and 
health are further exacerbated by lack of access to healthy foods. 
• 
Race and Ethnicity: Food insecurity is more common in people of color and those living in poverty. 
According to the USDA, 12.3% of U.S. households were food insecure in 2016: 22.5% of African 
American households, 18.5% of Hispanic households, 10.7% of other, non-Hispanic households, while 
only 9.3% of White households.30 As of the 2014 National Agricultural Workers Survey, 80% of U.S. 
farmworkers identify as Hispanic and only 53% had work authorization, leaving many members of this 
community vulnerable to economic impacts of climate change on U.S. agriculture.31 
• 
Tribal Communities: Many indigenous communities practice hunting, subsistence farming and ﬁshing, 
and are thus vulnerable to climate change impacts on local game, farming and aquatic habitats. Rising 
sea levels will also threaten freshwater and saltwater ﬁshing habitats for many indigenous coastal 
communities.32  
• 
Occupation: Agricultural workers are often undocumented and poorly paid, and at risk of climate-related 
illness. Declines in crop yields result in job and economic losses for agricultural workers and farming 
communities. Warmer temperatures are expanding the territory of certain crop pests, leading to higher 
use of toxic herbicides and pesticides and associated risks of pesticide-related illness.33 Farmworkers 
engage in heavy labor even during extreme heat. Repeated dehydration may be the cause of epidemic 
chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology in agricultural communities around the world.34 
• 
Pregnant Women: Nutrition is essential to healthy pregnancy, nursing and newborn outcomes; poor 
nutrition is associated low birth weight and other adverse outcomes.35

• 
Collaborate with agencies, schools, and local institutions (e.g. hospitals) to support adoption of food 
procurement policies that healthy food systems. 
• 
Work with planning, public works, agricultural agencies, regional farmers and land trusts, and 
community organizations:
 
Promote urban and peri-urban agriculture and agricultural land conservation.  
 
Establish farmers markets, including allowance of SNAP EBT, and support other farm-to-fork 
programs
• 
Collaborate with planning agencies to ensure the local General Plan includes food access considerations, 
and promote zoning that supports farmers markets, healthy food retail outlets, and community gardens.36 
 
• 
Partner with schools and school districts: 
 
Develop programs to reduce meat served in school meals—e.g. “Meatless Mondays” 
 
Support and encourage prevention of food waste and composting of food waste in school cafeterias
 
Establish school gardens
 
Work with local farmers, agricultural commissioners, and community organizations to establish 
and expand farm to school programs
 
Integrate climate change into lessons about nutrition
• 
Collaborate with academic agricultural researchers and local agricultural organizations to educate growers 
and agricultural operations about agriculture-climate change-health connections. 
• 
Provide health data and considerations to support advocacy for subsidies for fruits and vegetable farming 
and for reduced federal subsidies for commodity crops.
• 
Collaborate across public health and environmental health programs to reduce food waste and improve 
safe surplus food donation.
 
Train environmental health specialists on climate change, food waste, and food insecurity using, 
for example, the Safe Surplus Food Donation Best Management Practices.37
 
Disseminate information on food waste reduction—for example the Safe Surplus Food Donation 
Toolkit—during routine food facilities inspections.38 
 
Integrate education about date labels and food waste into WIC and NEOP materials and outreach/
education programs. See the Save the Food Campaign.39  
 
Work with local food policy councils, businesses, and Environmental Health to reduce food waste 
and increase surplus food donation to local nonproﬁt hunger relief organizations.

Original: While most report little or no difﬁculty, 17.4% of Metro Area adults report that it is 
“very” or “somewhat” difﬁcult for them to access affordable, fresh fruits and vegetables.40
Modiﬁed: While most report little or no difﬁculty, 17.4% of Metro Area adults report that it 
is “very” or “somewhat” difﬁcult for them to access affordable, fresh fruits and vegetables. 
This is a growing concern as climate change impacts local agriculture and may increase 
food insecurity. 
• 
Educate communities, stakeholders, and policy makers about the impact of climate change on food 
security and nutrition and actions with climate and health beneﬁts. 
 
Educate communities on the food-climate change connection, and on the climate and health 
beneﬁts of reduced meat consumption and sustainable local food systems (urban farms, farmers 
markets, community gardens, organic food)
 
Encourage clients and community residents to reduce meat consumption and increase 
consumption of fruits and vegetables; buy locally and sustainably produced food and develop 
backyard and community gardens, and reduce food waste at home and when eating out. 
• 
Educate food handlers about climate change-related increased risk of food contamination and how to 
maintain hygiene in food preparation under conditions of extreme heat and water shortages.
• 
Educate health care providers on the health impacts of climate change and food systems and how to  
protect patient and community health. See A Physician’s Guide on Climate Change, Health and Equity.
